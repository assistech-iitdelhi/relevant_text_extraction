<p style="color:limegreen;">2:  Is Matter Around Us Pure </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">3:  How do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter, salt, spices, mineral water or juice that we buy from the market are pure </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">4:  Figure 2.1: Some consumable items </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">5:  Have you ever noticed the word  pure  written on the packs of these consumables </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">6:  For a common person pure means having no adulteration </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">7:  But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">8:  For example, milk is actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins etc </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">9:  When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">10:  A pure substance consists of a single type of particles </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">11:  In other words, a substance is a pure single form of matter. </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">12:  As we look around, we can see that most of the matter around us exist as mixtures of two or more pure components, for example, sea water, minerals, soil etc </p>
<p style="color:limegreen;">13:  are all mixtures. </p>
<p style="color:brown;">14:  2.1 What is a Mixture </p>
<p style="color:brown;">15:  Mixtures are constituted by more than one kind of pure form of matter </p>
<p style="color:brown;">16:  We know that dissolved sodium chloride can be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation </p>
<p style="color:brown;">17:  However, sodium chloride is itself a pure substance and cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents </p>
<p style="color:brown;">18:  Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. </p>
<p style="color:brown;">19:  Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances </p>
<p style="color:brown;">20:  Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. </p>
<p style="color:brown;">21:  Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance. </p>
<p style="color:brown;">22:  2.1.1 Types of mixtures </p>
<p style="color:grey;">23:  Depending upon the nature of the components that form a mixture, we can have different types of mixtures. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">24:  Activity 2.1 </p>
<p style="color:grey;">25:    Let us divide the class into groups A, B, C and D. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">26:    Group A takes a beaker containing 50 mL of water and one spatula full of copper sulphate powder </p>
<p style="color:grey;">27:  Group B takes 50 mL of water and two spatula full of copper sulphate powder in a beaker. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">28:    Groups C and D can take different amounts of copper sulphate and potassium permanganate or common salt (sodium chloride) and mix the given components to form a mixture. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">29:    Report the observations on the uniformity in colour and texture. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">30:    Groups A and B have obtained a mixture which has a uniform composition throughout </p>
<p style="color:grey;">31:  Such mixtures are called homogeneous mixtures or solutions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">32:  Some other examples of such mixtures are: (i) salt dissolved in water and (ii) sugar dissolved in water </p>
<p style="color:grey;">33:  Compare the colour of the solutions of the two groups </p>
<p style="color:grey;">34:  Though both the groups have obtained copper sulphate solution but the intensity of colour of the solutions is different </p>
<p style="color:grey;">35:  This shows that a homogeneous mixture can have a variable composition. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">36:    Groups C and D have obtained mixtures, which contain physically distinct parts and have non-uniform compositions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">37:  Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures </p>
<p style="color:grey;">38:  Mixtures of sodium chloride and iron filings, salt and sulphur, and oil and water are examples of heterogeneous mixtures. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">39:  Activity 2.2 </p>
<p style="color:grey;">40:    Let us again divide the class into four groups   A, B, C and D. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">41:    Distribute the following samples to each group: </p>
<p style="color:grey;">42:     Few crystals of copper sulphate to group A. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">43:     One spatula full of copper sulphate to group B. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">44:     Chalk powder or wheat flour to group C. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">45:     Few drops of milk or ink to group D. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">46:    Each group should add the given sample in water and stir properly using a glass rod </p>
<p style="color:grey;">47:  Are the particles in the mixture visible </p>
<p style="color:grey;">48:    Direct a beam of light from a torch through the beaker containing the mixture and observe from the front </p>
<p style="color:grey;">49:  Was the path of the beam of light visible </p>
<p style="color:grey;">50:    Leave the mixtures undisturbed for a few minutes (and set up the filtration apparatus in the meantime) </p>
<p style="color:grey;">51:  Is the mixture stable or do the particles begin to settle after some time </p>
<p style="color:grey;">52:    Filter the mixture </p>
<p style="color:grey;">53:  Is there any residue on the filter paper </p>
<p style="color:grey;">54:  Discuss the results and form an opinion. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">55:    Groups A and B have got a solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">56:    Group C has got a suspension. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">57:    Group D has got a colloidal solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">58:  Figure 2.2: Filtration </p>
<p style="color:grey;">59:  Now, we shall learn about solutions, suspensions and colloidal solutions in the following sections. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">60:  Questions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">61:  What is meant by a substance </p>
<p style="color:grey;">62:  List the points of differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">63:  2.2 What is a Solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">64:  A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances </p>
<p style="color:grey;">65:  You come across various types of solutions in your daily life </p>
<p style="color:grey;">66:  Lemonade, soda water etc </p>
<p style="color:grey;">67:  are all examples of solutions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">68:  Usually we think of a solution as a liquid that contains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved in it </p>
<p style="color:grey;">69:  But, we can also have solid solutions (alloys) and gaseous solutions (air) </p>
<p style="color:grey;">70:  In a solution there is homogeneity at the particle level </p>
<p style="color:grey;">71:  For example, lemonade tastes the same throughout </p>
<p style="color:grey;">72:  This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">73:  More to know </p>
<p style="color:grey;">74:  Alloys: Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals or ametal and a non-metal and cannot be separated into their components by physical methods </p>
<p style="color:grey;">75:  But still, an alloy is considered as a mixture because it shows the properties of its constituents and can have variable composition </p>
<p style="color:grey;">76:  For example, brass is a mixture of approximately 30% zinc and 70% copper. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">77:  A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components </p>
<p style="color:grey;">78:  The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it (usually the component present in larger amount) is called the solvent </p>
<p style="color:grey;">79:  The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent (usually present in lesser quantity) is called the solute. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">80:  Examples: </p>
<p style="color:grey;">81:  (i) A solution of sugar in water is a solid in liquid solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">82:  In this solution, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">83:  (ii) A solution of iodine in alcohol known as  tincture of iodine , has iodine (solid) as the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the solvent. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">84:  (iii) Aerated drinks like soda water etc., are gas in liquid solutions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">85:  These contain carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water (liquid) as solvent. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">86:  (iv) Air is a mixture of gas in gas </p>
<p style="color:grey;">87:  Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases </p>
<p style="color:grey;">88:  Its two main constituents are: oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%) </p>
<p style="color:grey;">89:  The other gases are present in very small quantities. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">90:  Properties of a solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">91:    A solution is a homogeneous mixture. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">92:    The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter </p>
<p style="color:grey;">93:  So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">94:    Because of very small particle size, they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">95:  So, the path of light is not visible in a solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">96:    The solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration </p>
<p style="color:grey;">97:  The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a solution is stable. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">98:  2.2.1 Concentration of a solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">99:  In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and B obtained different shades of solutions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">100:  So, we understand that in a solution the relative proportion of the solute and solvent can be varied </p>
<p style="color:grey;">101:  Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called a dilute, concentrated or a saturated solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">102:  Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms </p>
<p style="color:grey;">103:  In activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group A is dilute as compared to that obtained by group B. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">104:  Activity 2.3 </p>
<p style="color:grey;">105:    Take approximately 50 mL of water each in two separate beakers. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">106:    Add salt in one beaker and sugar or barium chloride in the second beaker with continuous stirring. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">107:    When no more solute can be dissolved, heat the contents of the beaker to raise the temperature by about 5 C. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">108:    Start adding the solute again. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">109:  Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium chloride, that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature, the same </p>
<p style="color:grey;">110:  At any particular temperature, a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">111:  In other words, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">112:  The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">113:  If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation level, it is called an unsaturated solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">114:  What would happen if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">115:  We can infer from the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at the same temperature. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">116:  The concentration of a solution is the amount (mass or volume) of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">117:  There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will learn only three methods. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">118:  (i)  Mass by mass percentage of a solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">119:  (ii)  Mass by volume percentage of a solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">120:  (iii) Volume by volume percentage of a solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">121:  Example 2.1 A solution contains 40 g of common salt in 320 g of water </p>
<p style="color:grey;">122:  Calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of the solution. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">123:  Solution: </p>
<p style="color:grey;">124:  Mass of solute (salt) = 40 g </p>
<p style="color:grey;">125:  Mass of solvent (water) = 320 g </p>
<p style="color:grey;">126:  We know, </p>
<p style="color:grey;">127:  Mass of solution = Mass of solute + Mass of solvent </p>
<p style="color:grey;">128:   = 40 g + 320 g </p>
<p style="color:grey;">129:   = 360 g </p>
<p style="color:grey;">130:  Mass percentage of solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">131:  2.2.2 What is a suspension </p>
<p style="color:grey;">132:  Non-homogeneous systems, like those obtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which solids are dispersed in liquids, are called suspensions </p>
<p style="color:grey;">133:  A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium </p>
<p style="color:grey;">134:  Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">135:  Properties of a Suspension </p>
<p style="color:grey;">136:    Suspension is a heterogeneous mixture. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">137:    The particles of a suspension can be seen by the naked eye. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">138:    The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">139:    The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed, that is, a suspension is unstable </p>
<p style="color:grey;">140:  They can be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration </p>
<p style="color:grey;">141:  When the particles settle down, the suspension breaks and it does not scatter light any more. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">142:  2.2.3 What is a colloidal solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">143:  The mixture obtained by group D in activity 2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">144:  The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread throughout the solution </p>
<p style="color:grey;">145:  Due to the relatively smaller size of particles, as compared to that of a suspension, the mixture appears to be homogeneous </p>
<p style="color:grey;">146:  But actually, a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">147:  Because of the small size of colloidal particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes </p>
<p style="color:grey;">148:  But, these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light as observed in activity 2.2 </p>
<p style="color:grey;">149:  This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">150:  Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole </p>
<p style="color:grey;">151:  This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the air. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">152:  (a) (b) </p>
<p style="color:grey;">153:  Figure 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not show </p>
<p style="color:grey;">154:  Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water and milk </p>
<p style="color:grey;">155:  shows Tyndall effect. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">156:  Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest </p>
<p style="color:grey;">157:  In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets of water, which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">158:  Figure 2.4: The Tyndall effect </p>
<p style="color:grey;">159:  Properties of a colloid </p>
<p style="color:grey;">160:    A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">161:    The size of particles of a colloid is too small to be individually seen by naked eyes. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">162:    Colloids are big enough to scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">163:    They do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite stable. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">164:    They cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration </p>
<p style="color:grey;">165:  But, a special technique of separation known as centrifugation (perform activity 2.5), can be used to separate the colloidal particles. </p>
<p style="color:grey;">166:  The components of a colloidal solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium </p>
<p style="color:grey;">167:  The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium </p>
<p style="color:grey;">168:  Colloids are classified acco------- fig  2   --------
