<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Objective and Subjective Reality</span></h2>
<p class="chblock"><em>What&#8217;s reality anyway? Just a collective hunch!</em></p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Lily Tomlin [<a href="reference.html#ref111"><span class="blue">Hamit 1993</span></a>]</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Objective reality</strong> is the world as it exists independent of any conscious entity observing it. Unfortunately, it is impossible for someone to perceive objective reality exactly as it is. This chapter describes how we perceive objective reality through our own <a id="pg59lev1"></a>subjectivity. This is done through a philosophical discussion as well as with examples of perceptual illusion.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev6.1"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">6.1</span></span> Reality Is Subjective</h3>
<p class="noindent">The things we sense with our eyes, ears, and bodies are not simply a reflection of the world around us. We create in our minds the realities that we think we live in. <strong>Subjective reality</strong> is the way an individual perceives and experiences the external world in his own mind. Much of what we perceive is the result of our own made-up fiction of what happened in the past, and now believe to be the &#8220;truth.&#8221; We continually make up reality as we go along even though most of us do not realize it.</p>
<p class="indent">Abstract philosophy with no application to VR? That is certainly a valid opinion. Take a look at Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.1"><span class="blue">6.1</span></a>. What is the objective reality? An old lady or a young lady? Look again, and try to see if you can perceive both. This is a classic textbook example of an ambiguous image. However, there is neither an old lady or a young lady. What actually exists in objective reality is a black-and-white image made of ink on paper or pixels on a digital display. This is essentially what we are doing with VR&#8212;creating artificial content and presenting that to users so that they perceive our content as being real.</p>
<p class="indent">Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.2"><span class="blue">6.2</span></a> demonstrates how reality is what we make of it. The image is a 100-plus-year-old face with a resolution of 14 &#215; 18 grayscale pixels [<a href="reference.html#ref114"><span class="blue">Harmon 1973</span></a>]. If you live in the United States then you may recognize who this is a picture of, even though there is no possible way you could have met the individual. If you do not live in the United States, then you may not recognize the face. The picture is a low-resolution image of the face on the US five dollar bill&#8212;President Abraham Lincoln. Culture and our memories (even if made up by ourselves or through someone else) contribute significantly to what we see. We don&#8217;t see Abraham Lincoln because he looks like Abraham Lincoln, we see Abraham Lincoln because we &#8220;know&#8221; what Abraham Lincoln looks like even though none of us alive today have ever met him.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_61"></a>Einstein and Freud, although coming from very different perspectives, came to the same conclusion that reality is malleable, that our own point of view is an irreducible part of the equation of reality. Now with VR, not only do we get to experience the realities of others but we get to <em>create</em> objective realities that are more directly communicated (vs. indirectly through a book or television) for others to experience through their own subjectivity.</p>
<p class="indent">Science attempts to take subjectivity out of the universe, but that can often only be done under controlled conditions. In our day-to-day lives outside of the lab, our perceptions depend upon context. VR enables us to take some of the subjectivity out of synthetically created worlds by controlling conditions as done in a lab. Although much of VR experiences occur within individuals&#8217; own minds, by understanding how different perceptual processes work we can better lead people&#8217;s minds for them to more closely experience our created realities as we intend.</p>
<p class="indent">We go about our lives and subconsciously organize sensory inputs via our made-up &#8220;rules&#8221; and match those to our expected outcomes (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.3"><span class="blue">7.3</span></a>). Have you ever drunk orange juice when you were expecting milk? If so, then you may have gained a new experience of orange juice; if we don&#8217;t perceive what we expect to perceive then we can perceive things very differently. When we are surprised or in need of deeper understanding, then our brains further transform, analyze, and manipulate the data via conceptual knowledge. At that time, our mental model of the world can be modified to match future expectations.</p>
<p class="indent">Facts, algorithms, and geometry are not enough for VR. By better understanding human perception, we can build VR applications that enable us to more directly connect the objective realities we create, by manipulating digital bits, into the minds of users. We seek to better understand how humans perceive those bits in order to more directly convey our intention to users in a way that is well received and interpreted.</p>
<p class="indent">The good news is that VR does not need to perfectly replicate reality. Instead we just need to present the most important stimuli well and the mind will fill in the gaps.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev6.2"></a><strong><span class="font">6.2</span> Perceptual Illusions</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">For most situations, we feel like we have direct access to reality. However, in order to create that feeling of direct access, our brains integrate various forms of sensory input along with our expectations. In many cases, our brains have been hardwired to predict certain things based on repeated exposure over a lifetime of perceiving. This hardwired subconscious knowledge influences the way we interpret and experience the <a id="page_62"></a>world and enables our perception and thinking to take shortcuts, which provides more room for higher-level processing. Normally we don&#8217;t notice these shortcuts. However, when atypical stimuli are apparent then <strong>perceptual illusions</strong> can result. These illusions can help us understand the shortcuts and how the brain works. The remarkable thing about some of these illusions is that even when you know things are not the way they seem, it is still difficult to perceive it in some other way. The subconscious mind is indeed powerful even when the conscious mind knows something to the contrary.</p>
<p class="indent">Our brains are constantly and subconsciously looking for patterns in order to make sense of the stream of information coming in from the senses. In fact, the subconscious can be thought of as a filter that only allows things out of the ordinary that are not predictable to pass into consciousness (Sections <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.3"><span class="blue">7.9.3</span></a> and <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.1"><span class="blue">10.3.1</span></a>). In many cases, these predictable patterns are so hardwired into the brain that we perceive these patterns even when they do not exist in reality.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps the earliest philosophical discussion of perception and the illusion of reality created by patterns can be found within Plato&#8217;s <em>The Republic</em> (Plato, ~350 BC). Plato used the analogy of a person facing the back of a cave that is alive with shadows, with the shadows being the only basis for inferring what real objects are. Plato&#8217;s cave was actually a motivation that revolutionized the VR industry back in the 1990s with <a id="pg62lev1"></a>the creation of the <strong>CAVE</strong> VR system [<a href="reference.html#ref52"><span class="blue">Cruz et al. 1992</span></a>] that projects light onto walls surrounding the user, creating an immersive VR experience (Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.2"><span class="blue">3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to helping design VR systems, knowledge of perceptual illusions can help VR creators better understand human perception, identify and test assumptions, interpret experimental results, better design worlds, and solve problems as issues are discovered. The following sections demonstrate some virtual illusions that serve as building blocks for further investigation into perception.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.1"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.1</span> 2D Illusions</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Even for simple 2D shapes we don&#8217;t necessarily perceive the truth. The Jastrow illusion demonstrates how size can be misinterpreted&#8212;look at Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.3"><span class="blue">6.3</span></a> and try to determine which shape is larger. It turns out neither shape is larger&#8212;measure the height and width of the two shapes and you will find the shapes are identical, although the lower one appears to be larger.</p>
<p class="indent">The Hering illusion (Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.4"><span class="blue">6.4</span></a>) is a geometrical perceptual illusion that demonstrates straight lines do not always appear to be straight. When two straight and parallel lines are presented in front of a radial background, the lines convincingly appear as if they are bowed outward.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 6.4</span> The Hering illusion. The two horizontal lines are perfectly parallel although they appear bent.</strong> (Courtesy of Fibonacci)</p>
<p class="indentt">These simple 2D illusions show we should not necessarily trust our perceptions alone (although that is a good place to start) when calibrating VR systems, as judgments can depend upon the surrounding context.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.2"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.2</span> Illusory Boundary Completion</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.5"><span class="blue">6.5</span></a> shows three images, each with three &#8220;Pac Man&#8221; shapes similar to the classic video game of the 1980s. Between the three Pac Men in the leftmost figure, you might see a large white triangle overlaid on another slightly darker upside-down triangle. The perception of a triangle is known as the Kanizsa illusion, a form of <strong>illusory contour</strong> where boundaries are perceived even when no boundary actually exists. If you cover up these Pac Men then the supposed edges and triangles disappear. The middle figure shows how a triangle might appear in the corner of a rendered room. The rightmost figure shows how such a non-existent shape can even appear in the context of the real world.</p>

<p class="indent">Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.6"><span class="blue">6.6</span></a> shows two more illusory contour images where our minds fill in the gaps resulting in perceived 3D shapes where those shapes don&#8217;t actually exist. Gestalt theory states that the whole is other than the sum of its individual parts and is described in Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.4"><span class="blue">20.4</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_65"></a>Illusory contours demonstrate that we do not need to perfectly replicate reality, but we do need to present the most essential stimuli to induce objects into users&#8217; minds.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.3"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.3</span> Blind Spot</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The mind can also perceive emptiness even when something is right in front of us. The <strong>blind spot</strong> is an area on the retina where blood vessels leave the eye and there are no light-sensitive receptors. Blind spots are so large one can make a person&#8217;s head disappear when they are sitting across the room [<a href="reference.html#ref106"><span class="blue">Gregory 1997</span></a>]. We can see (or not see!) the effect of the blind spot by a simple diagram as demonstrated in Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.7"><span class="blue">6.7</span></a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.4"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.4</span> Depth Illusions</strong></h4>
<h5 class="h5a"><strong>The Ponzo Railroad Illusion</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.8"><span class="blue">6.8</span></a> shows the Ponzo railroad illusion where the top yellow rectangle appears to be larger than the bottom yellow rectangle. In actuality the two yellow lines/rectangles are identical in shape (try measuring them for yourself). This occurs because we interpret the converging sides according to linear perspective as parallel lines receding <a id="pg65lev1"></a>into the distance (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>). In this context, we interpret the upper yellow rectangle as though it were farther away, so we see it as larger&#8212;a farther object would have to be larger in actual physical size than a nearer one for both to produce retinal images of the same size.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 6.9</span> An Ames room creates the illusion of dramatically different sized people. Even though we logically know such differences in human sizes are not possible, the scene is still convincing.</strong> (Courtesy of PETER ENDIG/AFP/Getty Images)</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>The Ames Room</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">In an Ames room such as that shown in Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.9"><span class="blue">6.9</span></a>, a person standing in one corner appears to the observer to be a giant, while a person standing in the other corner appears to be impossibly small. The illusion is so convincing that a person walking back and forth from the left corner to the right corner appears to grow or shrink.</p>
<p class="indent">An Ames room is designed so that from a specific viewpoint, the room appears to be an ordinary room. However, this is a trick of perspective and the true shape of the room is trapezoidal: the walls are slanted and the ceiling and floor are at an incline, and the right corner is much closer to the viewer than the left corner (Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.10"><span class="blue">6.10</span></a>). The resulting illusion shows our perceptions can be affected by surrounding context. The illusion also occurs because the room is viewed with one eye through a pinhole to avoid any clues from stereopsis or motion parallax. When creating VR worlds, we want to build with consistency across sensory modalities as misperceptions can occur if we are not careful. Otherwise much stranger things than the Ames room illusion can occur!</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 6.10</span> The actual shape of an Ames room.</strong></p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.5"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.5</span> The Moon Illusion</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The moon illusion is the phenomenon that the moon appears larger when it is on the horizon than when it is high in the sky even though it remains the same distance from the observer and consists of the same visual angle. There are several explanations to the moon illusion (Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.11"><span class="blue">6.11</span></a>), but the most likely is because when the moon is near the horizon there are other features on the terrain that can be directly compared to the moon. Because of the distance cues of the terrain and horizon we have a better sense that the moon is further away. The more distance cues, the stronger the illusion. Similar to the Ponzo railroad illusion (Section <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2.4"><span class="blue">6.2.4</span></a>), the moon that is thought of as further away seems larger than the zenith moon (where the distance to the sky is perceived to be closer than the horizon) even though both moons take up the same area on the retina.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_68"></a><a id="fig6.11"></a><img src="../images/f0068-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 6.11</span> The moon illusion is the perception that the moon is larger when on the horizon than when high in the sky. The illusion can be especially strong when there are strong depth cues such as occlusion shown here.</strong></p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.6"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.6</span> Afterimages</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A <strong>negative afterimage</strong> is an illusion where the eyes continue seeing the inverse colors of an image even after the image is no longer physically present. An afterimage can be demonstrated by staring at the small red, green, and yellow dots below the lady&#8217;s eye in Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.12"><span class="blue">6.12</span></a>. After staring at this dot for 30&#8211;60 seconds, look to the blank area to the right of the picture at the X. You should now see a realistically colored image of the lady. How does this occur? The photoreceptive cells in our eyes become less sensitive to a color after a period of time and when we then look at a white area (where white is a mix of all colors), the inhibited colors tend not to be seen, leaving the opposed color.</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong>positive afterimage</strong> is a shorter-term illusion that causes the same color to persist on the eye even after the original image is no longer present. This can result in the perception of multiple objects when a single object moves across a display (called strobing&#8212;see Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.6"><span class="blue">9.3.6</span></a>).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev6.2.7"></a><strong><span class="font1">6.2.7</span> Motion Illusions</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Motion illusions can certainly occur in VR, and such illusions can cause disorientation and sickness (<a href="chapter12.html#ch12">Chapter <span class="blue">12</span></a>). We can use motion illusions to our advantage to create a sense of self-motion called vection (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.10"><span class="blue">9.3.10</span></a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>The Ouchi Illusion</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">If you look at the Ouchi illusion shown in Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.13"><span class="blue">6.13</span></a>, you may see the circle move left and/or right. If you yaw your head left/right while looking at the circle, the circle may appear to be unstable in front of a stable background. There are many explanations for such motion illusions, and the effect has been found to occur in a wide range of situations. One explanation is that the two differently oriented bars are perceived to be on different depth planes, causing them to seem to move relative to each other as the eyes move (similar to what would occur if the bars were actually on different depth planes).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_69"></a><a id="fig6.12"></a><img src="../images/f0069-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 6.12</span> Afterimage effect. Stare at the small red, green, and yellow dots just below the eye for 30&#8211;60 seconds. Then look to the blank area to the right at the X.</strong> (Image &#169; 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Opthalmology)</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 6.13</span> The Ouchi illusion. The rectangles appear to move although the image is static.</strong></p>
<h5 class="h5"><a id="page_70"></a><strong>Motion Aftereffects</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Motion aftereffects</strong> are illusions that occur after one views stimuli moving in the same direction for 30 seconds or more. After this time, one may perceive the motion to slow down or stop completely due to fatigue of motion detection neurons (a form of sensory adaptation&#8212;see Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2"><span class="blue">10.2</span></a>). When the motion stops or one looks away from the moving stimuli to non-moving stimuli, she may perceive motion in the opposite direction as the previously moving stimuli. We must therefore be careful when measuring perceptible motion or designing content for VR. For example, be careful of including consistently moving textures, such as moving water, in virtual worlds. Otherwise unintentional perceived motion may result after users look at such areas for long periods of time.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>The Moon-Cloud Illusion</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The moon-cloud illusion is an excellent example of induced motion&#8212;one may perceive clouds to be stable and the moon to be moving, when in fact the moon is stable and the clouds are moving. This illusion occurs because the mind assumes smaller objects are more likely to move than larger surrounding context (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.5"><span class="blue">9.3.5</span></a>).</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>The Autokinetic Effect</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>autokinetic effect,</strong> also known as autokinesis, is the apparent movement of a single stable point-light when no other visual cues are present. This effect occurs even when the head is held still. This is because the brain is not directly aware of unintentional small and slow eye movements (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.1.5"><span class="blue">8.1.5</span></a>) and there is no surrounding visual context to judge motion (i.e., no object-relative motion cues are available&#8212;see Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.2"><span class="blue">9.3.2</span></a>), so the movement is ambiguous; i.e., did the movement occur due to the eye moving or due to the point-light source moving? An observer does not know the answer, and the amount and direction of perceived motion varies. The autokinetic effect decreases as the size of the target increases, due to the brain&#8217;s assumption that objects taking up a large field of view are stable.</p>
<p class="indent">The autokinetic effect suggests that in order to create the illusion of stable worlds, large surrounding context should be used (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.4"><span class="blue">12.3.4</span></a>).</p>
