<h2 class="h2y"><a id="page_xix"></a><a id="pre"></a>Preface</h2>
<p class="noindent">I&#8217;ve known for some time that I wanted to write a book on VR. However, I wanted to bring a unique perspective as opposed to simply writing a book for the sake of doing so. Then insight hit me during Oculus Connect in the fall of 2014. After experiencing the Oculus Crescent Bay demo, I realized the hardware is becoming really good. Not by accident, but as a result of some of the world&#8217;s leading engineers diligently working on the technical challenges with great success. What the community now desperately needs is for content developers to understand human perception as it applies to VR, to design experiences that are comfortable (i.e., do not make you sick), and to create intuitive interactions within their immersive creations. That insight led me to the realization that I need to stop focusing primarily on technical implementation and start focusing on higher-level challenges in VR and its design. Focusing on these challenges offers the most value to the VR community of the present day, and is why a new VR book is necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">I had originally planned to self-publish instead of spending valuable time on pitching the idea of a new VR book to publishers, which I know can be a very long, arduous, and disappointing path. Then one of the most serendipitous things occurred. A few days after having the idea for a new VR book and committing to make it happen, my former undergraduate adviser, Dr. John Hart, now professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana&#8211;Champaign and, more germanely, the editor of the Computer Graphics Series of ACM Books, contacted me out of the blue. He informed me that Michael Morgan of Morgan &#38; Claypool Publishers wanted to publish a book on VR content creation and John thought I was the person to make it happen. It didn&#8217;t take much time to enthusiastically accept their proposal, as their vision for the book was the same as mine.</p>
<p class="indent">I&#8217;ve condensed approximately 20 years and 30,000 hours of personal study, application, notes, and VR sickness into this book. Those two decades of my VR career have somehow been summarized with six months of intense writing and editing from <a id="page_xx"></a>January to July of 2015. I knew, as others working hard on VR know, the time is now, and after finishing up a couple of contracts I was finally able to put other aspects of my life on hold (clients have been very understanding!), sometimes writing more than 75 hours a week. I hope this rush to get these timely concepts into one book does not sacrifice the overall quality, and I am always seeking feedback. Please contact me at <span class="weblink"><a href="http://book@nextgeninteractions.com"><span class="blue">book@nextgeninteractions.com</span></a></span> to let me know of any errors, lack of clarity, or important points missed so that an improved second edition can emerge at some point.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>It all started in 1980</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">I owe much of my pursuit of developing VR systems and applications to my parents. It started at the age of six with an Atari game system that my family couldn&#8217;t afford but I wanted so badly. For Christmas 1980, I somehow received it. Then in 1986 my mother took away the games in hopes of curing my addiction, which naturally forced me to make my own games (with advanced moving 2D sprites!) on the family&#8217;s Commodore 64. Here, I taught myself programming and essential software design concepts, such as simple computer graphics and collision detection, which turned out to be quite important for VR development. At that point, she thankfully gave up on trying to cure me. I also owe my father, who connected me with my first internship in the summer of 1992 after my junior year of high school at a design firm where he worked. My job was to deliver plots from the printers to the designers. This did not completely fill my time, and I somehow managed to gain access to AutoCad and 3D Studio R2 (long before today&#8217;s 3ds Max!). I was soon extruding 2D architectural plans into 3D worlds and animating horrible-looking flat-shaded polygons in the evenings and weekends when nobody was the wiser.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>SIGGRAPH 1995 and 1996</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">After regrettably missing SIGGRAPH 1994, I somehow acquired the conference course notes on creating virtual worlds and other related concepts. Soon afterwards, I discovered the SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program and realized that was my ticket to the conference. After realizing what I missed, I was not going to leave the opportunity to chance. I sought out a referral from Dr. John Hart, a professor very heavily involved with SIGGRAPH. He must have given me a solid referral based on my initiative and passion for computer graphics, as I had not yet taken a class from him. John would later become my undergraduate adviser and eventually editor of this book. Both his advice through the years and SIGGRAPH had an enormous influence on my career. In fact, I ended up leading the SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program more than a <a id="page_xxi"></a>decade later, out of appreciation and respect for its ability to inspire careers in computer graphics.</p>
<p class="indent">I was quite fortunate to be accepted to the 1995 SIGGRAPH Student Volunteer Program in Los Angeles, which is where I first experienced VR and have been fully hooked ever since. Having never attended a conference up to that point that I was this passionate about, I was completely blown away by its people and its magnitude. I was no longer alone in this world; I had finally found &#8220;my people.&#8221; Soon afterward, I found my first VR mentor, Richard May, now director of the National Visualization and Analytics Center. I enthusiastically jumped in on helping him build one of the world&#8217;s first immersive VR medical applications at Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratories. Richard and I returned to SIGGRAPH 1996 in New Orleans, where I more intentionally sought out VR. VR was now bigger than ever and I remember two things from the conference that defined my future. One was a course on VR interactions by the legendary Dr. Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. and one of his students, Mark Min&#233;. The other event was a VR demo that I still remember vividly to this day&#8212;and still one of the most compelling demos I&#8217;ve seen yet. It was a virtual Legoland where the user built an entire world around himself by snapping Legos and Lego neighborhoods together in an intuitive, almost effortless manner.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>Post-1996</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">SIGGRAPH 1996 was a turning point for me in knowing what I wanted to do with my life. Since that time, I have been fortunate to know and work with many individuals that have inspired me. This book is largely a result of their work and their mentorship.</p>
<p class="indent">Since 1996, Dr. Brooks unknowingly inspired me to move on from a full-time dream VR job in the late 1990s at HRL Laboratories to pursue VR at the next level at UNC-Chapel Hill. Once there, I managed to persuade Dr. Brooks to become my PhD adviser in studying VR latency. In addition to being a major influence on my career, two of his books&#8212;<em>The Mythical Man Month</em> and more recently <em>The Design of Design</em>&#8212;are heavily referenced throughout Part <a href="part06.html#part6"><span class="blue">VI</span></a>, Iterative Design. He also had significant input for Part <a href="part02.html#part2"><span class="blue">II</span></a>, Perception, especially Chapter <a href="chapter16.html#ch16"><span class="blue">16</span></a>, Latency, as some of that writing originally came from my dissertation that was largely a result of significant suggestions from him. His serving as adviser for Mark Min&#233;&#8217;s seminal work on VR interaction also indirectly affected Part <a href="part05.html#part5"><span class="blue">V</span></a>, Interaction. It is still quite difficult for me to fathom that before Dr. Brooks came along, bytes&#8212;the molecules of all digital technology&#8212;were not always 8 bits in size like they are defined to be today. That 8-bit design decision he made in the 1960s, which most all of us computer scientists now just assume to be an inherent truth, is just one of his many contributions to computers in general, <a id="page_xxii"></a>along with his more specific contributions to VR research. It boggles my mind even more how a small-town kid like myself, growing up in a tiny town of 1,200 people on the opposite side of the country, somehow came to study under an ACM Turing Award recipient (the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in computer science). For that, I will forever be grateful to Dr. Brooks and the UNC-Chapel Hill Department of Computer Science for admitting me.</p>
<p class="indent">In 2009, I interviewed with Paul Mlyniec, president of Digital ArtForms. At some point during the interview, I came to the realization that this was the man that led the VR Lego work from SIGGRAPH that had inspired and driven me for over a decade. The interface in that Lego demo is one of the first implementations of what I refer to as the 3D Multi-Touch Pattern in Section <a href="chapter28.html#lev28.3.3"><span class="blue">28.3.3</span></a>, a pattern two decades ahead of its time. I&#8217;ve now worked closely with Paul and Digital ArtForms for six years on various projects, including ones that have improved upon 3D Multi-Touch (Sixense&#8217;s MakeVR also uses this same viewpoint control implementation). We are currently working together (along with Sixense and Wake Forest School of Medicine) on immersive games for neuroscience education funded by the National Institutes of Health. In addition to these games, several other examples of Digital ArtForms&#8217; work (along with work from its sister company Sixense that Paul was essential in helping to form) are featured throughout the book.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>VR Today</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">After a long VR drought after the 1990s, VR is bigger than ever at SIGGRAPH. An entire venue, the VR Village, is dedicated specifically to VR, and I have the privilege of leading the Immersive Realities Contest. After so many years of heavy involvement with my SIGGRAPH family, it feels quite fitting that this book is launched at the SIGGRAPH bookstore on the 20th anniversary of my discovery of SIGGRAPH and VR.</p>
<p class="indent">I joke that when I did my PhD Dissertation on latency perception for head-mounted displays, perhaps ten people in the world cared about VR latency&#8212;and five of those people were on my committee (in three different time zones!). Then in 2011, people started wanting to know more. I remember having lunch with Amir Rubin, CEO of Sixense. He was inquiring about consumer HMDs for games. I thought the idea was crazy; we could barely get VR to work well in a lab and he wanted to put it in people&#8217;s living rooms! Other inquiries led to work with companies such as Valve and Oculus. All three of these companies are doing spectacular jobs of making high-quality VR accessible, and now suddenly everyone wants to experience VR. Largely due to these companies&#8217; efforts, VR has turned a corner, transitioning from a specialized laboratory <a id="page_xxiii"></a>instrument available only to the technically elite, to a mainstream mode of content consumption available to any consumer. Now, most everyone that is involved in VR technology understands at least the basics of latency and its challenges/dangers, most notably motion sickness&#8212;the greatest risk for VR. Even better, ultra-low-latency hardware technologies (e.g., low-persistence OLED displays) that I once unsuccessfully searched the world for (I ended up having to build/simulate my own; the best I did was 7.4 ms of end-to-end latency with tracking and rendering performed at ~1,500 frames per second) are being developed in mass quantities by giants such as Samsung, Sony, Valve, and Oculus. Times have certainly changed!</p>
<p class="indent">The last 20 years of pursuing VR have truly been a dream. During that time, I imagined and even seriously considered starting companies devoted to VR, but it was never feasible until recently. Today it is more of a real fantasy than a simple dream, now that VR technology is delivering upon its promise of the 1990s. Describing the feeling is like trying to describe a VR experience. Words cannot do justice as to what it is like to be a part of this VR community and contributing to the VR revolution. Through my VR consulting and contracting firm, NextGen Interactions, I have the privilege of working with some of the best companies in the world that are able to do things that could only previously be imagined. Virtual reality is unlike any technology devised to date and has the potential not only to change the fictional synthetic worlds we make up but to change people&#8217;s real lives. I very much look forward to seeing what this community discovers and creates over the next 20 years!</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">It would be untrue if I claimed that this book was completely based on my own work. The book was certainly not written in isolation and is a result of contributions from a vast number of mentors, colleagues, and friends in the VR community who have been working just as hard as I have over the years to make VR something real. I couldn&#8217;t possibly say everything there is about VR, and I encourage readers to further investigate the more than 300 references discussed throughout the book, along with other writings. I&#8217;ve learned so much from those who came before me as well as those newer to VR. Unfortunately, it is not possible to list everyone who has influenced this book, but the following gives thanks to those who have given the most support.</p>
<p class="indent">First of all, this book would never have been anything beyond a simple self-published work without the team at Morgan &#38; Claypool Publishers and ACM Books. On the Morgan &#38; Claypool Publishers side, I&#8217;d like to thank Executive Editor Diane Cerra, Editorial Assistant Samantha Draper, Copyeditor Sara Kreisman, Production <a id="page_xxiv"></a>Manager Paul Anagnostopoulos, Artist Laurel Muller, Proofreader Jennifer McClain, and President Michael Morgan. On the ACM Books side, I&#8217;d like to thank Computer Graphics Series Editor John Hart and Editor-in-Chief M. Tamer &#214;zsu.</p>
<p class="indent">This book you are reading is very different and much better than initial drafts due to suggestions from great reviewers. Reviewers of the book include Paul Mlyniec (president of Digital ArtForms), Arun Yoganandan (formerly of Digital ArtForms and Disney, now a research engineer at Samsung), Russell Taylor (former professor of computer science at UNC&#8211;Chapel Hill, now cofounder of Rheomics and independent consultant at Relia Solve), Beau Cronin (an expert VR neuroscientist at Salesforce, who is writing his own VR book), Mike McArdle (cofounder of the Virtual Reality Learning Experience), Ryan McMahan (professor at University of Texas at Dallas), Eugene Nalivaiko (professor at New Castle University), Kyle Yamamoto (cofounder and game developer at MochiBits), Ann McNamara (professor at Texas A&#38;M), Mark Fagiano (professor at Emory University), Zach Wendt (computer games guru and independent software developer), Francisco Ortega (postdoc fellow at Florida International University and who is writing his own VR book), Matt Cook (emerging technologies librarian at the University of Oklahoma), Sharif Razzaque (CTO of Inneroptic), Neeta Nahta (cofounder of NextGen Interactions), Kevin Rio (UX researcher at Microsoft), Chris Pusczak (project manager at Burnout Game Ventures and SymbioVR), Daniel Ackley (psychologist), my mother, Susan Jerald (behavioral psychologist), and my father, Rick Jerald (CEO of Envirocept).</p>
<p class="indent">Additional specific input came from Mark Bolas (professor at the University of Southern California), Neil Schneider (founder of Meant to be Seen and founder/executive director of the Immersive Technology Alliance), Eric Greenbaum (attorney and founder of Jema VR), John Baker (COO of Chosen Realities), Denny Unger (founder and president of Cloudhead Games), Andrew Robinson and Sigurdur Gunnarsson (developers at CCP Games), Max Rheiner (founder and CTO of Somniacs), Chadwick Wingrave (founder of Conquest Creations), Barry Downes (CEO of TSSG), Denise Quesnel (research associate at Emily Carr University of Art and Design, cofounder of the Canadian &#38; Advanced Imaging Society, and cochair of the SIGGRAPH VR Village), Nick England (founder and CEO of 3rdTech), Jesse Joudrey (CEO of VRChat and CTO of Jespionage Entertainment), David Collodi (cofounder and CTO of CI Dynamics), David Beaver (cofounder of the Overview Institute), and Bill Howe (CEO of the Growth Engine Group).</p>
<p class="indent">I&#8217;ve been very fortunate to be employed by some amazing organizations and even more amazing bosses that are world-leading experts in VR. These individuals gave me the opportunity to make a career out of what I love doing, and working with them led to much of what is contained within these pages: Richard May of Battelle <a id="page_xxv"></a>Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (now director of the National Visualization and Analytics Center), Michael Papka of Argonne National Laboratories, Mike Daily of HRL Laboratories, Greg Schmidt of the Naval Research Laboratory, Steve Ellis and Dov Adelstein of NASA Ames, Paul Mlyniec of Digital ArtForms, and Michael Abrash at Valve (now at Oculus).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to those listed above, the following individuals have been invaluable as VR advisers/mentors throughout the years: Howard Neely, research project manager at HRL Laboratories and now CEO at Three Birds Systems; Ron Azuma, senior research staff member at HRL Laboratories and now at Intel; Fred Brooks, Henry Fuchs, Mary Whitton, and Anselmo Lastra&#8212;all professors at UNC&#8211;Chapel Hill; Jeff Bellinghausen, formerly lead engineer at Digital ArtForms and CTO at Sixense, now at Valve; and Amir Rubin, CEO of Sixense.</p>
<p class="indent">I also very much appreciate working with the teams at Sixense, Valve, and Oculus. I&#8217;ve been incredibly impressed with the people and their commitment to creating the highest-quality software and hardware, and not just resurrecting VR but raising awareness to levels beyond anything that previously existed.</p>
<p class="indent">Others I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with who have influenced this book include Rupert Meghnot and his team at Burnout Game Ventures, especially Chris Pusczak of the SymbioVR team; Jan Goetgeluk of Virtuix; Simon Solotko, the Kickstarter guru who marketed some of the biggest VR Kickstarters such as the Virtuix Omni, the Cyberith Virtualizer, and the Sixense STEM; the UNC Effective Virtual Environments team; Karl Krantz of Silicon Valley Virtual Reality, who was the first to pioneer local meetups where his events are duplicated throughout the world; and Henry Velez, founder of the RTP Virtual Reality Enthusiasts, which I now have the privilege of leading.</p>
<p class="indent">I&#8217;ve also enjoyed working with literally thousands of volunteers through ACM SIGGRAPH, IEEE VR, and IEEE 3DUI, ranging from student volunteers to the legends of computer graphics and VR. In particular, I&#8217;d like to thank the SIGGRAPH conference committees of the last 20 years. Of course, I&#8217;ve also enjoyed working with those outside of conferences, ranging from those in academics to those doing startups. Then there are those who have given me invaluable feedback on VR projects, ranging from middle schoolers to VR experts.</p>
<p class="indent">I&#8217;d especially like to thank Neeta Nahta, my partner in business and life, who comes from a completely different world of sales, financial analysis, and corporate boardrooms. Her input enables me to see VR from a different perspective than most anyone else in the VR community. Seeing VR as a sustainable and profitable business that adds real value to the world will ensure that this time VR is here for good.</p>
<p class="indent">I would also like to thank the Link Foundation for supporting me through the Link Foundation Advanced Simulation and Training Fellowship, which helped to fund <a id="page_xxvi"></a>graduate work in studying and reducing latency. It is certainly an honor to be funded by the foundation started by Edwin A. Link, who built the world&#8217;s first mechanical flight simulator in 1928 (Figure <a href="chapter03.html#fig3.5"><span class="blue">3.5</span></a>), which some consider to be one of the first VR systems, as well as to be among a list of world-leading VR experts who also received the Fellowship. I highly encourage any graduate student readers who have already selected a dissertation topic to apply for the Link Foundation Fellowship ($28,500 to be awarded for 2016).
