<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>ITERATIVE DESIGN</strong></h2>
<p class="chblock"><em>Design thinking takes a solution-focused approach to problem solving, working collaboratively to iterate an endless, shifting path toward perfection. It works toward product goals via specific ideation, prototyping, implementation, and learning steps to bring the appropriate solution to light</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Up to this point, this book has provided a background on the mechanisms of perception, VR sickness, content creation, and interaction. However, such mechanisms are not entirely understood and very much depend on the goals and design of the VR project. Furthermore, assumptions about the real world or how we perceive and interact with it do not always hold in VR. One cannot simply look up the numbers when designing VR experiences or get the experience perfect on the first attempt. VR design is also very different than 2D desktop or mobile application design, and there is not nearly as much known or standardized about VR. VR design must be iteratively created based off of continual redesign, prototyping, and feedback from real users. In fact, the design of many VR experiences is due to &#8220;accidental discoveries&#8221; that were not initially intended (Andrew Robinson and Sigurdur Gunnarsson, personal communication, May 11, 2015). This chapter focuses on iterative design concepts to help the team move toward ideal experiences as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">With new development platforms such as Unity and other tools, VR experiences can be created in a fraction of the time they could be created compared to just a few years ago. Experienced designers can now literally create a simple VR experience in hours, without any programming experience required. Some modifications can be as easy as a click of a button, and some assets and behaviors built by others can be integrated with basic programming skills. Because of how quickly simple VR experiences can be built and modified, prototyping basic individual components can often be done in a day or less. However, to go beyond the basics, designers should either be programmers themselves, learn basic programming skills for simple prototyping and testing, or work directly in pairs with programmers. Note that this is not to say professional programmers are not required for creating compelling VR experiences. Integrating advanced/innovative features and behaviors, understanding software architecture, and writing clean code takes time to do properly and are essential for creating efficient and maintainable code.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><strong>The Define-Make-Learn Cycle</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although a single overall detailed process is not appropriate for VR design, there is general agreement that <strong>iterative design</strong> consists of defining the project, building prototypes, learning from users, and continually improving upon previous ideas. Careful consideration of these stages is critical to optimizing user experience and comfortable VR.</p>
<p class="indent">Part <a href="part06.html#part6"><span class="blue">VI</span></a> discusses the philosophy of iterative design and then the three iterative stages (<a href="part06.html#figVI.1">Figure VI.1</a>) as summarized below.</p>
<p class="indentnumbert">1. <strong>The Define Stage.</strong> This stage attempts to answer the question &#8220;What do we make?&#8221; and includes everything from the high-level vision to listing requirements.</p>
<p class="indentnumber">2. <strong>The Make Stage.</strong> This stage answers the question &#8220;How do we make it?&#8221; and then proceeds to make it.</p>
<p class="indentnumber"><a id="page_371"></a>3. <strong>The Learn Stage.</strong> This stage answers the question &#8220;What works and what does not work?&#8221; The answers are fed back into the Define Stage to refine what is to be made.</p>
<p class="indentt">Although conceptually these stages are performed in sequence, they are tightly interwoven and often occur in parallel. Within the three stages, various smaller process pieces are described that can be fit into the larger iterative process as needed. These individual pieces may or may not be used depending on the project and what part of the life cycle the process is in. The stages are often not consistent even across iterations of the same project. Thus, it would both limit and overcomplicate the design process to try to formalize a sequence of VR design processes, or even to formalize each individual process piece. Instead, basic overviews of the process concepts are described within each of the three primary stages. The specifics will depend on the project goals and team preference.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Overview of Chapters</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Part <a href="part06.html#part6"><span class="blue">VI</span></a></strong> consists of five chapters that describe the overall iterative process as well as more detailed specific processes as they apply to creating VR experiences.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter30.html#ch30"><span class="blue">30</span></a>, Philosophy of Iterative Design,</strong> first provides a review of overarching concepts essential to VR design. Iterative design as it applies to VR is especially dependent on art, science, human-centered design, iteration, the specifics of the project, and the team creating the experience.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter31.html#ch31"><span class="blue">31</span></a>, The Define Stage,</strong> discusses how VR application ideas are created and refined. Fifteen ways of defining different aspects of the project are described in this chapter.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter32.html#ch32"><span class="blue">32</span></a>, The Make Stage,</strong> discusses the actual implementation of the idea into initial tangible prototypes and then into more polished experiences that are delivered to end users.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter33.html#ch33"><span class="blue">33</span></a>, The Learn Stage,</strong> describes core research concepts and explains how to obtain qualitative feedback from representative users, collect more objective/quantitative data, improve the design through constructivist approaches, and formally test/compare different implementations.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter34.html#ch34"><span class="blue">34</span></a>, Iterative Design: Design Guidelines,</strong> summarizes the iterative process and lists a number of actionable guidelines to help VR creators move toward engaging experiences.</p>
