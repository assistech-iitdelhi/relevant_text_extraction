<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Measuring Sickness</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">VR sickness can be difficult to measure. One reason for this is VR sickness is polysymptomatic and cannot be measured by a single variable [<a href="reference.html#ref155"><span class="blue">Kennedy and Fowlkes 1992</span></a>]. Another challenge is the large variance between individuals. When effects of VR sickness do occur, they are typically small and weak impacts that disappear quickly upon completing the experience. Because many participants eventually adapt, testing the same participants can be a problem. Thus, researchers often choose to use between-subject study designs (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.4.1"><span class="blue">33.4.1</span></a>). These factors of large individual differences, weak effects, adaptation, and between-subject designs invariably lead to the conclusion <a id="pg195lev1"></a>that large sample sizes are required. A difficulty with experimenting over such a broad range of users is keeping experiment control conditions consistent.</p>
<p class="indent">Questionnaires or symptom checklists are the usual means of measuring VR sickness. These methods are relatively easy to do and have a long history of usage, but are subjective and rely on the participant&#8217;s ability to recognize and report changes. Postural stability tests and physiological measures are occasionally used due to their objective nature.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev16.1"></a><span class="font">16.1</span> The Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaire</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)</strong> was created from analyzing data from 1,119 users of 10 US Navy flight simulators. Twenty-seven commonly experienced symptoms were identified that resulted in the creation and validation of 16 symptoms [<a href="reference.html#ref157"><span class="blue">Kennedy et al. 1993</span></a>]. The 16 symptoms were found to cluster into three categories: oculomotor, disorientation, and nausea. The oculomotor cluster includes eye strain, difficulty focusing, blurred vision, and headache. The disorientation cluster includes dizziness and vertigo. The nausea cluster includes stomach awareness, increased salivation, and burping. When taking the questionnaire, participants rank each of the 16 symptoms on a 4-point scale as &#8220;none,&#8221; &#8220;slight,&#8221; &#8220;moderate,&#8221; or &#8220;severe.&#8221; The SSQ results in four scores: total (overall) sickness and three subscores of oculomotor, disorientation, and nausea.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_196"></a>The Kennedy SSQ has become a standard for measuring simulator sickness, and the total severity factor may reflect the best index of VR sickness. See Appendix <a href="appendixa.html#appa">A</a> for an example questionnaire containing the SSQ. Although the three subscales are not independent, they can provide diagnostic information as to the specific nature of the sickness in order to provide clues as to what needs improvement in the VR application. These scores can be compared to scores from other similar applications, or can be used as a measure of application improvement over time.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrary to suggestions by <a href="reference.html#ref157"><span class="blue">Kennedy et al.</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref157"><span class="blue">1993</span></a>], the SSQ has often been given before exposure to the VR experience in order to provide a baseline to compare the SSQ given after the experience. <a href="reference.html#ref342"><span class="blue">Young et al.</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref342"><span class="blue">2007</span></a>] found that when pre-questionnaires suggest VR can make users sick, then the amount of sickness those users report after the VR experience increases. Thus, it is now standard practice to only give a simulator sickness questionnaire after the experience to remove bias, although this comes at the cost of not having a baseline to compare with and risks users not being aware that VR can cause sickness. Those not in their usual state of good health and fitness before starting the VR experience should not use VR and definitely should not be included in the SSQ analysis.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="pg196lev1"></a><a id="lev16.2"></a><span class="font">16.2</span> Postural Stability</h3>
<p class="noindent">Motion sickness can be measured behaviorally through <strong>postural stability tests</strong>. Postural stability tests can be separated into those testing static and dynamic postural stability. A common static test is the Sharpened Romberg Stance: one foot in front of the other with heel touching toe, weight evenly distributed between the legs, arms folded across the chest, chin up. The number of times a subject breaks the stance is the postural instability measure [<a href="reference.html#ref251"><span class="blue">Prothero and Parker 2003</span></a>]. There are currently several commercial systems to assess body sway.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev16.3"></a><span class="font">16.3</span> Physiological Measures</h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Physiological measures</strong> can provide detailed data over the entire VR experience. Examples of physiological data that changes as sickness occurs include heart rate, blink rate, electroencephalography (EEG), and stomach upset [<a href="reference.html#ref161"><span class="blue">Kim et al. 2005</span></a>]. Changes in skin color and cold sweating (best measured via skin conductance) also occur with increased sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref113"><span class="blue">Harm 2002</span></a>]. The direction of change for most physiological measures of sickness is not consistent across individuals, so measuring absolute changes is recommended. Little research currently exists for physiological measures of VR sickness, and there is a need for more cost-effective and objective physiological measures of both resulting VR sickness and a person&#8217;s susceptibility to it [<a href="reference.html#ref68"><span class="blue">Davis et al. 2014</span></a>].</p>
