<p class="noindent">Virtual reality (VR) can provide our minds with direct access to digital media in a way that seemingly has no limits. However, creating compelling VR experiences is an incredibly complex challenge. When VR is done well, the results are brilliant and pleasurable experiences that go beyond what we can do in the real world. When VR is done badly, not only do users get frustrated, but they can get sick. There are many causes of bad VR; some failures come from the limitations of technology, but many come from a lack of understanding perception, interaction, design principles, and real users. This book discusses these issues by emphasizing the human element of VR. The fact is, if we do not get the human element correct, then no amount of technology will make VR anything more than an interesting tool confined to research laboratories. Even when VR principles are fully understood, the first implementation is rarely novel and almost never ideal due to the complex nature of VR and the countless possibilities that can be created. The VR principles discussed in this book will enable readers to intelligently experiment with the rules and iteratively design toward innovative experiences.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, most VR creators have been engineers (the author included) with expertise in technology and logic but limited in their understanding of humans. This is primarily due to the fact that VR has previously been so technically challenging that it was difficult to build VR experiences without an engineering background. Unfortunately, we engineers often believe &#8220;I am human, therefore I understand other humans and what works for them.&#8221; However, the way humans perceive and interact with the world is incredibly complex and not typically based on logic, mathematics, or a user manual. If we stick solely to the expertise of knowing it all through engineering and logic, then VR will certainly be doomed. We have to accept human perception and behavior the way it is, not the way logic tells us it should be. Engineering will always be essential as it is the core of VR systems that everything else builds upon, but VR itself presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology, and we must understand both to do VR well.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_2"></a>Technically minded people tend to dislike the word &#8220;experience&#8221; as it is less logical and more subjective in nature. But when asked about their favorite tool or game they often convey emotion as they discuss how, for example, the tool responds. They talk about how it makes them feel often without them consciously realizing they are speaking in the language of emotion. Observe how they act when attempting to navigate through a poorly designed voice-response system for technical support via phone. In their frustration, they very well may give up on the product they are calling about and never purchase from that company again. The experience is important for everything, even for engineers, for it determines our quality of life on a moment-by-moment basis. For VR, the experience is even more critical. To create quality VR, we need to continuously ask ourselves and others questions about how we perceive the VR worlds that we create. Is the experience understandable and enjoyable? Or is it sometimes confusing to use while at other times just all-out frustrating and sickness inducing? If the VR experience is intuitive to understand, easily controlled, and comfortable, then just like anything in life, there will be a sense of mastery and satisfaction with &#8220;logical&#8221; reasons why it works well. Emotion and cognition are tightly coupled, with cognition more often than not justifying decisions that were actually made emotionally. We must create VR experiences with both emotion and logic.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>What This Book Is</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book focuses on <strong>human-centered design,</strong> a design philosophy that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving (Norman, 2013). More specifically, this book focuses on the human elements of VR&#8212;how users perceive and intuitively interact with various forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating content that is pleasing and useful, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR applications.</p>
<p class="indent">Good VR design starts with an understanding of both technology and perception. It requires good communication between human and machine, indicating what interactions are possible, what is currently occurring, and what is about to occur. Human-centered design also comes about through observation, for humans are often unaware of their perceptual processes and methods of interacting (at least for VR that works well). Getting the specification of a VR experience is difficult, and rarely does a VR creator do it well for his first few projects. In fact, even VR experts do not perfectly define the project from the start if they are creating a novel experience. A human-centered design principle, like lean methods, is to avoid completely defining the problem at the start and to iterate upon repeated approximations and modifications through rapid tests of ideas with real users.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_3"></a>Developing intuitive VR should not be driven by software/hardware engineering considerations alone (e.g., we need to do much more than figure out how to efficiently display at the highest resolution available based on the most current hardware). A good portion of this book is devoted to how the human mind works in order to help readers create higher-quality VR applications. VR design, however, goes beyond just technology and psychology; VR is intensely multidisciplinary. VR is an incredibly complex challenge and the study, design, and implementation of high-quality VR requires an understanding of various disciplines, including the behavioral and social sciences, neuroscience, information and computer science, physics, communications, art, and even philosophy. When reflecting back upon VR design and implementation, <a href="reference.html#ref336"><span class="blue">Wingrave and LaViola</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref336"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>] point out: &#8220;Practitioners must be carpenters, electricians, engineers, artists, and masters of duct tape and Velcro.&#8221; This book takes a broad perspective, applying insights from various disciplines to VR design.</p>
<p class="indent">In summary, this book provides basic theory, an overview of various concepts useful for VR, examples that put the theory and concepts into more understandable form, useful guidelines, and a foundation for further exploration and interaction design for virtual worlds that do not yet exist.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="pg3lev1"></a><strong>What This Book Is Not</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are more questions about VR than there are answers and the intent of this book is not to attempt to provide all of the answers. VR covers a broad range of imaginary spaces broader than the real world; nobody could possibly have all the answers to the real world, so it is unreasonable to expect to find all the answers for virtual worlds. Instead, this book attempts to help readers build and iterate upon creative answers and compelling experiences. Although this book can&#8217;t possibly cover all aspects of VR in detail, it does provide an overview of various topics and delves more deeply into those that are most important. References are provided throughout for those wishing to further study concepts of interest.</p>
<p class="indent">In some cases, the concepts presented in this book follow well-understood principles or conclusive research (although even conclusive research rarely holds 100% of the time across all conditions). In other cases, concepts are not the &#8220;truth&#8221; but have been found to be useful in the way we think about design and interaction. Studying theory can be useful, but VR development should always follow pragmatism over theory.</p>
<p class="indent">Although there is a brief chapter on getting started (Chapter <a href="chapter36.html#ch36"><span class="blue">36</span></a>), and there are tips throughout on high- and mid-level implementation concepts, this book is not a step-by-step tutorial of how to implement an example VR system. In fact, this book intentionally contains no code or equations so that all concepts can be understood <a id="page_4"></a>by anyone from any discipline (references are provided for more rigorous detail). Although researchers have been experimenting with VR for decades (Section <a href="chapter02.html#lev2.1"><span class="blue">2.1</span></a>), VR in no way comes close to reaching its full potential. Not only are there many unknowns, but VR implementation very much depends on the project. For example, a surgical training system is very different from an immersive film.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>Who This Book Is For</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is for the entire team that works on a VR project, not just for those who define themselves as designers. It is intended to act as a foundation for anyone and everyone involved with creating VR experiences. The book also is meant to serve as a bridge between academic research and practical advice to a wide range of individuals who wish to build compelling experiences. This includes designers, managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user experience professionals so the entire team can have a common understanding and language of VR. Everyone involved with a VR project should understand at least the basics of perception, VR sickness, interaction, content creation, and iterative design. VR requires specialized experts in various disciplines to each contribute in their own unique way, but we each must also know at least a little about human-centered design in order to effectively communicate with teammates and to integrate the various components together into a seamless, quality experience.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>How to Read This Book</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Readers may wish to read and use this book differently depending on their background, particular interests, and how they would like to apply it.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Newcomers</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Those completely new to VR who want a high-level understanding will most appreciate Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a>, Introduction and Background. After reading Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a>, the reader may want to skip ahead to Part <a href="part07.html#part7"><span class="blue">VII</span></a>, The Future Starts Now. Once these basics are understood, most of Part <a href="part04.html#part4"><span class="blue">IV</span></a>, Content Creation, should be able to be understood. As the reader learns more about VR, the other parts will become easier to digest.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Teachers</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">This book will be especially relevant to interdisciplinary VR courses. Teachers will want to choose chapters that are most relevant to the course requirements and student interests. It is highly suggested that any VR course take a project-centered approach. In such a case, the teacher should consider the suggestions below for both students <a id="page_5"></a>and practitioners. An outline for starting a first project, albeit slightly different for a class project, is outlined in Chapter <a href="chapter36.html#ch36"><span class="blue">36</span></a>, Getting Started.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Students</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Students will gain a core understanding of VR by first gaining a high-level overview of VR through Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a>, Introduction and Background. For those wishing to understand theory, Part <a href="part02.html#part2"><span class="blue">II</span></a>, Perception, and Part <a href="part03.html#part3"><span class="blue">III</span></a>, Adverse Health Effects, will be invaluable. For students working on VR projects, they should also follow the advice below for practitioners.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Practitioners</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Practitioners who want to immediately get the most important points that apply to their VR creations will want to start with the practitioner chapters that have a leading star (*) in the table of contents (mostly Parts <a href="part04.html#part4"><span class="blue">IV</span></a>&#8211;<a href="part06.html#part6"><span class="blue">VI</span></a>). In particular, they may want to start with the design guidelines chapters at the end of each part, where each part contains multiple chapters on one of the primary topics. Most of the guidelines provide back references to the relevant sections for more detailed information.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>VR Experts</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">VR experts will likely use this book more as a reference so they do not spend time reading material they are already familiar with. The references will also serve VR experts for further investigation. Those experts who primarily work with head-mounted displays may find Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a>, Introduction and Background, useful to understand how head-mounted displays fit within the larger scheme of other implementations of VR and augmented reality (AR). Those interested in implementing straightforward applications that have already been built may not find Part <a href="part02.html#part2"><span class="blue">II</span></a>, Perception, useful. However, for those who want to innovate with new forms of VR and interaction, they may find this part useful to understand how we perceive the world in order to help invent novel creations.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><strong>Overview of the Seven Parts</strong></h3>
<p class="hang"><strong>Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a>, Introduction and Background,</strong> provides a background of VR including a brief history of VR, different forms of VR and related technologies, and a broad overview of some of the most important concepts that will be further discussed in later parts.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part02.html#part2"><span class="blue">II</span></a>, Perception,</strong> provides a background in perception to educate VR creators on concepts and theories of how we perceive and interact with the world around us. <a id="page_6"></a>This part serves as an intellectual framework that will enable the reader to not only implement the ideas discussed in later chapters but more thoroughly understand why some techniques do or do not work, to extend those techniques, to intelligently experiment with new concepts that have a better chance of working without causing human factors issues, and to know when it might be appropriate to break the rules.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part03.html#part3"><span class="blue">III</span></a>, Adverse Health Effects,</strong> describes one of the most difficult challenges of VR and helps to reduce the greatest risk to VR succeeding at a massive scale: VR sickness. Whereas it may be impossible to remove 100% of VR sickness for the entire population, there are several ways to dramatically reduce it if we understand the theories of why it occurs. Other adverse health effects such as risk of injury, seizures, and aftereffects are also discussed.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part04.html#part4"><span class="blue">IV</span></a>, Content Creation,</strong> discusses high-level concepts for designing/building assets and how subtle design choices can influence user behavior. Examples include story creation, the core experience, environmental design, wayfinding aids, social networking, and porting existing content to VR.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part05.html#part5"><span class="blue">V</span></a>, Interaction,</strong> focuses on how to design the way users interact within the scenes they find themselves in. For many applications, we want to engage the user by creating an active experience that consists of more than simply looking around; we want to empower users by enabling them to reach out, touch, and manipulate that world in a way that makes them feel they are a part of the world instead of just a passive observer.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part06.html#part6"><span class="blue">VI</span></a>, Iterative Design,</strong> provides an overview of several different methods for creating, experimenting, and improving upon VR designs. Whereas each project may not utilize all methods, it is still good to understand them all to be able to apply them when appropriate. For example, you may not wish to conduct a formal and rigorous scientific user study, but you do want to understand the concepts to minimize mistaken conclusions due to confounding factors.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part07.html#part7"><span class="blue">VII</span></a>, The Future Starts Now,</strong> summarizes the book, discusses the current and future state of VR, and provides a brief plan to get started.</p>
