<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent">What is virtual reality (VR)? What does VR consist of and for what situations is it useful? What is different about VR that gets people so excited? How do developers engage users so that they feel present in a virtual environment? This part of the book answers such questions, and provides a basic background that later chapters build upon. This introduction and background serves as a simple high-level toolbox of options to intelligently choose from, such as different forms of virtual and augmented reality (AR), different hardware options, various methods of presenting information to the senses, and ways to induce presence into the minds of users.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a></strong> consists of five chapters that cover the basics of VR.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter01.html#ch1"><span class="blue">1</span></a>, What Is Virtual Reality?,</strong> begins by describing what VR is at a high level and what it is suitable/effective for. This includes descriptions of different forms of communication that are at the heart of what VR is&#8212;communication between the user and a system created by the VR designer.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter02.html#ch2"><span class="blue">2</span></a>, A History of VR,</strong> provides a history of VR starting with stereoscopes created in the 1800s. The concept and implementation of VR is not new.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter03.html#ch3"><span class="blue">3</span></a>, An Overview of Various Realities,</strong> discusses forms of reality ranging from the real world to augmented reality (AR) to VR. Whereas the focus of this book is on fully immersive VR, this chapter provides context of where VR fits into the overall picture of related technologies. The chapter also gives a high-level description of various forms of input and output hardware options that can be used as part of AR and VR systems.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_8"></a><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter04.html#ch4"><span class="blue">4</span></a>, Immersion, Presence, and Reality Trade-Offs,</strong> discusses the often-used terms of immersion and presence. Readers may be surprised to learn that realism is not necessarily the goal of VR and there are trade-offs for attempting to perfectly simulate reality, even if reality could be perfectly simulated.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter05.html#ch5"><span class="blue">5</span></a>, The Basics: Design Guidelines,</strong> concludes this introductory part of the book and gives a small number of guidelines for those looking to create VR experiences.</p>
