<p class="noindent">It is important to consider physical issues involved with the use of VR equipment. This chapter discusses physical fatigue, headset fit, injury, and hygiene.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev14.1"></a><strong><span class="font">14.1</span> Physical Fatigue</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Physical fatigue can be a function of multiple causes including the weight of worn/held equipment, holding unnatural poses, and navigation techniques that require physical motion over an extended period of time.</p>
<p class="indent">Some HMDs of the 1990s weighed as much as 2 kg [<a href="reference.html#ref50"><span class="blue">Costello 1997</span></a>]. Fortunately, the weights of HMDs have decreased and are not as much of an issue as they used to <a id="pg177lev1"></a>be. HMD weight is more of a concern when the HMD center of mass is far from the head center of mass (especially in the horizontal direction). If the HMD mass is not centered, then the neck must exert extra torque to offset gravity. In such a case, the worst problems occur when moving the head. This can tire the neck, which can lead to headaches. The offset mass not only can cause fatigue and headaches but may also modify the way in which the user perceives distance and self-motion [<a href="reference.html#ref333"><span class="blue">Willemsen et al. 2009</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Controller weight is typically not a major issue. However, some devices have their center of mass offset more than others. For such devices, trade-offs should be carefully considered before finalizing the decision on selecting controllers.</p>
<p class="indent">In the real world, humans naturally rest their arms when working. In many VR applications, there is not as much opportunity to rest the arms on physical objects. <strong>Gorilla arm</strong> is arm fatigue resulting from extended use of gestural interfaces without resting the arm(s). This typically starts to occur within about 10 seconds of having to hold the hand(s) up above the waist in front of the user. Line-of-sight issues should be considered when selecting hand-tracking devices (Section <a href="chapter27.html#lev27.1.9"><span class="blue">27.1.9</span></a>) so users are able to work comfortably with their hands in their lap and/or to the side of their body. Interaction techniques should be designed to not require the hands to be high and in front of the user for more than a few seconds at a time (Section <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.9"><span class="blue">18.9</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_178"></a>Some forms of navigation via walking (Section <a href="chapter28.html#lev28.3.1"><span class="blue">28.3.1</span></a>) can be exhausting after a period of time, especially when users are expected to walk long distances. Even standing can be tiring for some users, and often they will ask for a seat after some period of time. Sitting options should be provided for longer sessions, and the experience might be optimized for sitting with only occasional need to stand up and walk around. Weight becomes more of an issue for walking interfaces.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev14.2"></a><strong><span class="font">14.2</span> Headset Fit</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Headset fit</strong> refers to how well an HMD fits a user&#8217;s head and how comfortable it feels. HMDs often cause discomfort due to pressure or tightness at contact points between the HMD and head. Such pressure points vary depending on the HMD and user but typically occur around the eye sockets and on the ears, nose, forehead, and/or back of the head. Not only can this pressure be uncomfortable on the skin, but it can cause headaches. Headset fit can especially be an issue for those who wear eyeglasses.</p>
<p class="indent">Loose-fitting HMDs are also a concern as anything mounted on the head (unless bolted into the skull!) will wiggle if jolted enough because the human head has skin on it and the skin is not completely taut. When the user moves her head quickly, the HMD will move slightly. Such HMD slippage can aggravate the skin and cause small scene motions. Slippage can be reduced by making lighter HMDs but will not completely go <a id="pg178lev1"></a>away. The small motions can be compensated for by calculating the amount of wiggle and moving the scene appropriately to remain stable relative to the eyes.</p>
<p class="indent">Most HMDs are able to be physically adjusted, and users should make sure to adjust the HMD at the start of use as discomfort can increase over time and users are less likely to adjust when they are fully engaged in the experience. Such adjustments do not, however, guarantee a quality fit for all users. Although basic head sizes can be used for different people, head sizes vary considerably more than along a single measurement. For optimal fit, scanning of the head can be used for customized HMD design [<a href="reference.html#ref212"><span class="blue">Melzer and Moffitt 2011</span></a>]. Other options currently being investigated by Eric Greenbaum (personal communication, April 29, 2015) of Jema VR (and creator of About Face VR hygiene solutions) include pump-inflatable liners, and ergonomic inserts designed to spread the force of the HMD along the most robust parts of the user&#8217;s face (forehead and cheekbones), and different forms of foam.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev14.3"></a><strong><span class="font">14.3</span> Injury</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Various types of injury are a risk in fully immersive VR due to multiple factors.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Physical trauma</strong> is an injury resulting from a real-world physical object that is an increased risk with VR due to being blind and deaf to the real world (e.g., trauma resulting from falling or hitting physical objects). Sitting is preferred from a safety <a id="page_179"></a>perspective as standing can be more risky due to the potential of colliding with real-world walls/objects/cables and tripping or losing balance. Hanging the wires from the ceiling can reduce problems if the user does not rotate too much. A human <strong>spotter</strong> should closely watch a standing or walking user to help stabilize them if necessary. Harnesses, railing, or padding might also be considered. HMD cables can also be dangerous as there is a possibility of minor whiplash if a short or tangled/stuck cable pulls on the head when the user makes a sudden movement. Even if physical injury does not occur, something as simple as softly bumping against an object or a cable touching the skin can cause a break-in-presence. Active haptic devices can be especially dangerous if the forces are too strong. Hardware designers should design the device so the physical forces are not able to exceed some maximum force. Physical safety mechanisms can also be integrated into the device.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Repetitive strain injuries</strong> are damage to the musculoskeletal and/or nervous systems, such as tendonitis, fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and ligamentous injury, resulting from carrying out prolonged repeated activities using rapid carpal and metacarpal movements [<a href="reference.html#ref50"><span class="blue">Costello 1997</span></a>]. Such injuries have been reported with using standard input devices such as mice, gamepads, and keyboards. Any interaction technique that requires continual repetitive movements is undesirable (as it is for a real-world task). Properly designed VR interfaces have the potential for less repetitive strain injuries <a id="pg179lev1"></a>than traditional computer mouse/keyboard input due to not being constrained to a plane. Fine 3D translation when holding down a button is stressful (Paul Mlyniec, personal communication, April 28, 2015), so button presses are sometimes performed by the non-translating hand at the cost of the interaction not being as intuitive or direct.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Noise-induced hearing loss</strong> is decreased sensitivity to sound that can be caused by a single loud sound or by lesser audio levels over a long period of time. Permanent ear damage can occur with continuous sound exposure (over 8 h) that has an average level in excess of 85 dB or with a single impulse sound in excess of 130 dB [<a href="reference.html#ref274"><span class="blue">Sareen and Singh 2014</span></a>]. Ideally, sounds should not be continuously played and maximum audio levels should be limited to prevent ear damage. Unfortunately, limiting maximum levels can be difficult to guarantee as developers cannot fully control specific systems of individual users. For example, some users may have their own sound system and speakers or have their computer volume gain set differently. However, audio levels can be set to a maximum in software. For example, as users move close to a sound source, code can confirm the audio resulting from the simulation does not exceed a specified level.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev14.4"></a><strong><span class="font">14.4</span> Hygiene</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">VR hardware is a <strong>fomite</strong>&#8212;an inanimate physical object that is able to harbor pathogenic organisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi) that can serve as an agent for transmitting diseases between different users of the same equipment [<a href="reference.html#ref50"><span class="blue">Costello 1997</span></a>]. Hygiene <a id="page_180"></a>becomes more important as more users don the same HMD. Such challenges are not unique to VR, as traditional interfaces such as keyboards, mice, telephones, and restrooms have similar issues, albeit interfaces close to or on the face may be more of an issue.</p>
<p class="indent">The skin on the face produces oils and sweats. Further, facial skin is populated by a variety of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria. Heat from the electronics and lack of ventilation around the eyes can add to sweating. This may result in an unpleasant user experience and in the most extreme cases can present health risks. Kevin <a href="reference.html#ref334"><span class="blue">Williams</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref334"><span class="blue">2014</span></a>] divides hygiene into wet, dry, and unusual:</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; <strong>Wet</strong> includes sweat, oils, and makeup/hair products.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; <strong>Dry</strong> includes skin, scalp, and hair.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; <strong>Unusual</strong> includes lice/eggs and earwax.</p>
<p class="indentt">Some professionals clean their 3D polarized glasses with an ultraviolet sterilization process, but unfortunately such a process breaks down plastic material (known as UV degradation) and thus the process can only be used so many times before making the hardware unusable (Eric Greenbaum, personal communication, April 29, 2015). The film industry primarily uses industrial washing machines to clean their glasses. <a id="pg180lev1"></a>Neither of these methods is appropriate for HMDs (with possibly the exception of the cheaper cell-phone holder HMDs).</p>
<p class="indent">Although wiping down the system with alcohol can be helpful, this does not necessarily remove all dangerous biological agents as it can be difficult to clean cracks and porous material (material often used where the skin touches the HMD). Metal, plastic, and rubber are more resistant than porous materials and are often used, but such impermeable material is not as breathable or comfortable for users. The lenses should be wiped with a nonabrasive microfiber cloth with a mild detergent/antibacterial soap and dried before reuse. An inner cleanable cap for each individual user that prevents direct contact with the top of the head, as used by Disney, can be used to further reduce risk [<a href="reference.html#ref237"><span class="blue">Pausch et al. 1996</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref216"><span class="blue">Mine 2003</span></a>]. For audio, earbuds should not be used for more than one user. Instead larger earphones should be used that cover the entire ear and can be easily wiped clean.</p>
<p class="indent">Eric Greenbaum has created multiple removable-from-the HMD solutions to the hygiene problem through About Face VR. About Face VR provides several options of placing material between the HMD and face that drastically reduces transfer of biological agents. Options include personal textile pads/liners that are washed as part of one&#8217;s laundry, and impermeable liners that can be wiped down with alcohol or other disinfectant for public use.</p>

<p class="indent">If using controllers, provide hand sanitizer for users to sanitize their hands before and after use. Be prepared for the worst case of users becoming ill by keeping sick bags, plastic gloves, mouthwash, drinks, light snacks, air freshener, and cleaning products nearby. Keep such items out of view as such cues can cause users to think about getting sick, which can cause them to get sick.</p>
