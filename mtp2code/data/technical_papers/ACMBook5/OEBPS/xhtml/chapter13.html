<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Eye Strain, Seizures, and Aftereffects</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Non-moving visual stimuli can also cause discomfort and adverse health effects. Known problems include accommodation-vergence conflict, binocular-occlusion conflict, and flicker. Aftereffects are also discussed, which can indirectly result from scene motion as well as non-moving visual stimuli.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev13.1"></a><strong><span class="font">13.1</span> Accommodation-Vergence Conflict</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg173lev1"></a>In the real world, accommodation is closely associated with vergence (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>), resulting in clear vision of closely located objects. If one focuses on a near object, the eyes automatically converge and if one focuses on a distant object, the eyes automatically diverge resulting in a sharp single fused image. The HMD <strong>accommodation-vergence conflict</strong> occurs due to the relationship between accommodation and vergence not being consistent with what occurs in the real world. Overriding the physiologically coupled oculomotor processes of vergence and accommodation can result in eye fatigue and discomfort [<a href="reference.html#ref15"><span class="blue">Banks et al. 2013</span></a>].</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev13.2"></a><strong><span class="font">13.2</span> Binocular-Occlusion Conflict</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Binocular-occlusion conflict</strong> occurs when occlusion cues do not match binocular cues, e.g., when text is visible but appears at a distance behind a closer opaque object. This can be quite confusing and uncomfortable for the user.</p>
<p class="indent">Many desktop first-person shooter/perspective games contain a 2D overlay/heads-up display to provide information to users (Section <a href="chapter23.html#lev23.2.2"><span class="blue">23.2.2</span></a>). If such games are ported to VR, then it is essential that either such information be removed or the overlay should be given a depth such that information is occluded properly when behind scene geometry.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_174"></a><a id="lev13.3"></a><strong><span class="font">13.3</span> Flicker</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Flicker</strong> (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.2.4"><span class="blue">9.2.4</span></a>) is distracting and can cause eye fatigue, nausea, dizziness, headache, panic, confusion, and in rare cases seizures and loss of consciousness [<a href="reference.html#ref175"><span class="blue">Laviola 2000</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref254"><span class="blue">Rash 2004</span></a>]. As discussed in Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.2.4"><span class="blue">9.2.4</span></a>, the perception of flicker is a function of many variables. Trade-offs in HMD design can result in flicker becoming more perceivable (e.g., wider field of view and less display persistence), so it is essential to maintain high refresh rates so that flicker does not cause health problems. Flicker, however, is not only a function of the refresh rate of the display. Flashing lights in a virtual environment can also cause flicker, and it is important that VR creators be careful not to create such flashing. Dark scenes can also be used to increase dark adaptation, which reduces the perception of flicker.</p>
<p class="indent">A <strong>photic seizure</strong> is an epileptic event provoked by flashing lights that can occur in situations ranging from driving by a picket fence in the real world to flashing stimuli in VR, and occurs in about 0.01% of the population [<a href="reference.html#ref316"><span class="blue">Viirre et al. 2014</span></a>]. Those experiencing seizures generally show a brief period of absence where they are awake but do not respond. Such seizures do not always result in convulsions so are not always obvious. Repeated seizures can lead to brain injury and a lower threshold for future episodes. Reports of the frequency at which seizures most commonly occur vary widely from a range of 1 to 50 Hz, likely due to different conditions. Because the conditions that <a id="pg174lev1"></a>will most likely cause seizures within a specific HMD or application are not known, flickering or flashing of lights at any rate should be avoided. Anyone with a history of epilepsy should not use VR.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev13.4"></a><strong><span class="font">13.4</span> Aftereffects</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Immediate effects during immersive experiences are not the only dangers of VR usage. Problems may persist after returning to the real world. A <strong>VR aftereffect</strong> (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.3"><span class="blue">10.2.3</span></a>) of VR usage is any adverse effect that occurs after VR usage but was not present during VR usage. Such aftereffects include perceptual instability of the world, disorientations, and flashbacks.</p>
<p class="indent">About 10% of those using simulators experience negative aftereffects [<a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>]. Those who experience the most sickness during VR exposure usually experience the most aftereffects. Most aftereffect symptoms disappear within an hour or two. The persistence of symptoms longer than six hours has been documented but fortunately remains statistically infrequent.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="reference.html#ref158"><span class="blue">Kennedy and Lilienthal</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref158"><span class="blue">1995</span></a>] compared effects of simulator sickness to effects of alcohol intoxication using postural stability measurements after VR usage and <a id="page_175"></a>suggested to restrict subsequent activities in a similar way that is done for alcohol intoxication. There is a danger that such effects could contribute to problems that involve more than the individual, such as vehicular accidents. In fact, many VR entertainment centers require that users not drive for at least 30&#8211;45 min after exposure [<a href="reference.html#ref175"><span class="blue">Laviola 2000</span></a>]. We, as the VR community, should do the same in doing our part to not only minimize VR sickness but also educate those not familiar with VR sickness of potentially dangerous aftereffects.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev13.4.1"></a><span class="font1">13.4.1</span> Readaptation</h4>
<p class="noindent">As described in Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.1"><span class="blue">10.2.1</span></a>, a perceptual adaptation is a change in perception or perceptual-motor coordination that serves to reduce or eliminate sensory discrepancies. A <strong>readaptation</strong> is an adaptation back to a normal real-world situation after adapting to a non-normal situation. For example, after a sea voyage, many travelers need to readapt to land conditions, something that can last weeks or even months [<a href="reference.html#ref160"><span class="blue">Keshavarz et al. 2014</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Over time VR users adapt to shortcomings of VR. After adapting to those shortcomings, when the user returns to the real world, a readaptation occurs due to the real world being treated as something novel compared to the VR world to which the user <a id="pg175lev1"></a>has adapted. An example of adaptation and readaptation occurs when the rendered field of view is not properly calibrated to match the physical field of view. This causes the image in the HMD to appear distorted. Because of this distortion, when the user turns the head everything but the center of the display will seem to move in an odd way. Once a user becomes accustomed to this odd motion and the world seems stable, then adaptation has occurred. Unfortunately, after adaptation to the incorrect field of view, the inverse may very well occur when the user returns to the real world. That is, the person might perceive an inverse distortion and the world to not appear stable when turning the head. Such adaptation (called position-constancy adaptation; Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.2"><span class="blue">10.2.2</span></a>) have been found to occur with minifying/magnifying glasses [<a href="reference.html#ref321"><span class="blue">Wallach and Kravitz 1965b</span></a>] and HMDs where the rendered field of view and physical field of view don&#8217;t match [<a href="reference.html#ref77"><span class="blue">Draper 1998</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Until the user has readapted to the real world, aftereffects may persist, such as drowsiness, disturbed locomotor and postural control, and lack of hand-eye coordination [<a href="reference.html#ref156"><span class="blue">Kennedy et al. 2014</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref160"><span class="blue">Keshavarz et al. 2014</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Two approaches are possible for helping with readaptation: natural decay and active readaptation [<a href="reference.html#ref73"><span class="blue">DiZio et al. 2014</span></a>]. <strong>Natural decay</strong> is the refrainment of any activity such as relaxing with little movement and the eyes closed. This approach can be less <a id="page_176"></a>sickness inducing but can prolong the readaptation period. <strong>Active readaptation</strong> involves the use of real-life targeted activities aimed at recalibrating the sensory systems affected by the VR experiences, such as hand-eye coordination tasks. Such activity might be more sickness inducing but can speed up the readaptation process.</p>
<p class="indent">Fortunately, as stated in Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.2"><span class="blue">10.2.2</span></a>, users are able to adapt to multiple conditions (called dual adaptation). Expert users who frequently go back and forth between a VR experience and the real world may have less of an issue with aftereffects and other forms of VR sickness.</p>
