<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">The Define Stage</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>Define Stage</strong> of a project is the beginning but also continues until the end as more is discovered from the Make and Learn Stages. All parts of the Define Stage should be described from the client&#8217;s or user&#8217;s point of view and be able to be understood by anyone. That way multiple perspectives can be taken into account.</p>
<p class="indent">Be careful of &#8220;analysis paralysis&#8221;&#8212;trying to have every single detail figured out before pulling the trigger. Spending too much time at the beginning on the Define Stage can be detrimental to the project because what is defined may not be possible with today&#8217;s technology or may not ultimately be what customers want. In many cases, it is best to start with only defining a general overview of the project rather than getting into too much detail. In some cases, developers (e.g., solo indie developers) might even choose a &#8220;fire then aim&#8221; strategy of first starting with the Make Stage. In other cases, analysis and definition can be more important (e.g., command and control applications where the VR system must be integrated with existing systems and procedures). Knowing when to start implementing is largely a matter of experience and judgment of knowing when is enough. If you are not sure if you are ready to move on to the Make Stage, then it is better to err on moving forward. The Define Stage will always be waiting for your return to fill in more details as necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter discusses several Define Stage concepts. The concepts are listed in approximate order they might occur, but like everything else in iterative design, the order is best chosen based on project needs. Not all projects will use all of the concepts, although the more concepts that are eventually used and refined, the more likely the success of the project. Note for all of these concepts, it is not just important to define <em>what</em> the project is, but it is important to state <em>why</em> those decisions were made. By doing so, the team can better justify keeping, changing, or removing each element on future iterations.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_380"></a><a id="lev31.1"></a><span class="font">31.1</span> <strong>The Vision</strong></h3>
<p class="chblock"><em>Pyramids, cathedrals, and rockets exist not because of geometry, theory of structures, or thermodynamics, but because they were first pictures&#8212;literally visions&#8212;in the minds of those who conceived them</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Eugene Ferguson, <em>Engineering and the Mind&#8217;s Eye</em> [<a href="reference.html#ref86"><span class="blue">1994</span></a>]</p>
<p class="noindent">Like any great engineering achievement, a VR project must be started by someone somewhere. What is the overall vision? What is trying to be achieved? Why is it being done? This is the chance to make it all up. With unlimited resources, what could be achieved?</p>
<p class="indent">The early vision is largely speculation. There is no way to know the final solution or even what all the concerns are until the project is completed. How can a project be defined when there are so many unknowns? Guess! Articulated guesses beat unspoken or vague models [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>]. Guessing forces the team to think about the exposed assumptions and to think very carefully about the design. Guessing is the beginning of an iterative journey that will better define goals as more is learned. Both the formulation of the problem and its solution will evolve together, with interchange <a id="pg380lev1"></a>of information between the two [<a href="reference.html#ref75"><span class="blue">Dorst and Cross 2001</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Intelligent and informed speculation is based on the real world and its people. Refined speculation begins by talking with others as discussed in the next section.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.2"></a><span class="font">31.2</span> <strong>Questions</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">At first thought, it seems having such creative freedom to make it all up would be easy to do. However, this is often the stage of the project that can be the most challenging. In fact, <a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>] states &#8220;the hardest part of design is deciding what to design.&#8221; Fortunately, VR projects do not exist in isolation. Understanding the background and context of how the project will fit in with the larger picture helps to define the project.</p>
<p class="indent">The most important time to get feedback from others is during the conceptualization of the idea. Innovative ideas, ones that create new interactions, experiences, and significantly better results, come about by reconsidering the goals and focusing on what people really want. The best way to determine what people really want is accomplished by talking with people and asking lots of questions. However, it&#8217;s not as simple as asking what they want. Often, what people think they want is not what they actually want. As a consultant, the author has found one of the greatest services to provide is to help clients discover what they want. Don&#8217;t expect people to straight out tell you what they want and do not expect your assumptions of what they want to be correct. Asking the right questions is essential.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_381"></a>The most important questions to ask at this stage begin with the word &#8220;why.&#8221; The statement &#8220;People don&#8217;t want to buy a drill, they want to buy a hole&#8221; does not go deep enough into what the desired goal actually is. Why does a client want to buy a hole? She wants to install bookshelves. Why does she want to install bookshelves? She wants a place to conveniently store books. Why does she want to conveniently store books? Perhaps she wants to store information in an organized manner so she can more conveniently access that information and she is frustrated with her existing bookshelf. The creative solution may be something completely different than a bookshelf. Similarly, consumers do not want to buy HMDs. They might want to effectively train for specific tasks, or they may want to bring more customers into their place of business. A VR demo might persuade potential customers to physically travel to the store to purchase merchandise that is largely unrelated to VR technology.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to continuously asking &#8220;why&#8221; questions, here are some examples of useful high-level questions to understand background and context.</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; What is the inspiration/motivation? Is it meant to replace some existing system (a real-world system or an older VR system)? Or is it meant to create an entirely new experience?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Who are the decision makers? Who are the principal stakeholders and intended beneficiaries?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Where will the system be deployed? Will it be in a corporate office, at a theme park, or in people&#8217;s homes?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Is the VR project part of a larger vision? Is the project a brand-new initiative, or is it being fit into an existing project? How is the VR project related to other projects? Even if not directly a part of a larger vision or project, the relationship between them may still be important.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Does the project play a minor or major role in the organization? What impact will it have on the organization?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; What are the characteristics of the cultural, social, and politic aspects of the target organization or community? Military settings are very different from entertainment settings.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Who will the project affect other than the users?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; How many users will be using the system? How many locations?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; What is the planned life span once deployed? Is the expectation for this to be a single project or will there be further work (assuming success) after completion?</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_382"></a>&#8226; What are the desired outcomes? How will success be measured?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; What are the resources and their limitations? What is the budget range and what is the time frame of when the project must be completed?</p>
<p class="indentt">More detailed questions should also be asked as one begins to better understand the context. Talking with subject-matter experts is essential, especially for non-entertainment applications. One qualified opinion from a subject-matter expert is often more valuable than 100 uninformed opinions (although a wider uninformed audience can be useful as well since they may be your future customers). Respect experts&#8217; time by preparing specific questions that are relevant to their expertise.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to asking questions, it is helpful to see for yourself. Physically travel to the site to meet with insiders so they can explain what will likely be an alien world for you. Ask various individuals there whether they are employees or customers, what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how it might be done better. Carefully observe and take notes about people&#8217;s actions in addition to their words&#8212;their actions may indeed be more informative. If you can put yourself in their shoes, then you will understand. Ask questions not only to others but also ask questions to yourself. How do they currently perform tasks? If the goal is to better educate people about a topic, then how do people currently learn about that topic? What barriers do you see that are keeping them from learning more effectively?</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.3"></a><strong><span class="font">31.3</span> Assessment and Feasibility</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As one learns more about the goal of the project, it is useful to step back and assess if VR is the right solution. Whereas VR has the potential to cross all disciplines and be useful in a wide variety of applications, that does not mean VR is the ideal solution to every problem. VR is certainly not the ideal tool for every problem today as the technology is still far from being perfected.</p>
<p class="indent">Example questions in assessing and therefore determining the feasibility of a VR project include the following.</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; What results must be achieved for the project to be considered a success?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; What functionality must be supported? Can non-VR technology support it better than today&#8217;s VR technology?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Will a VR solution fit within the real-world context such as the environment, organization, and culture?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; What are the competitive advantages to existing and/or non-VR solutions? What are the alternatives and the trade-offs?</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_383"></a>&#8226; What is the expected profit, cost savings, and/or other added benefits?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; What are the hidden costs outside of project development? Examples include shipping or deployment costs, user-training costs, marketing and sales, and maintenance.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Is the project possible given the budget, time, and other resources?</p>
<p class="indentt">The answers to these questions are rarely binary. Often, a mix of the real world and VR is optimal (e.g., traditional education mixed with practice in a simulator).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.4"></a><strong><span class="font">31.4</span> High-Level Design Considerations</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The user experience is the end of a chain of design considerations, and the context in which different design options are considered is important. It is useful to think about design from three different points of view [<a href="reference.html#ref19"><span class="blue">Bolas 1989</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref20"><span class="blue">1992</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Design <em>with</em> virtual environments</strong> focuses on the use of VR to help solve an existing problem or to create a new invention. Carefully considering application needs can drive the design when VR is used as a design tool itself, for example, scientific data visualization or automotive design. If done well, VR can amplify human intelligence during the investigation and solving of real-world problems <a id="pg383lev1"></a>(e.g., enabling easier matching and recognition of complex patterns). With this approach, VR systems should complement, not replace, other tools and forms of media in order to maximize insight.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Design <em>for</em> virtual environments</strong> focuses on improving the hardware and software of VR systems themselves. With this approach, the designer should carefully consider the technology affordances used to provide the experience. For example, considering input device characteristics and classes (Chapter <a href="chapter27.html#ch27"><span class="blue">27</span></a>) can help the designer choose, modify, or upgrade specific hardware. Considering different interaction patterns and techniques (Chapter <a href="chapter28.html#ch28"><span class="blue">28</span></a>) can help to improve existing implementations and to develop new interaction metaphors.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Design <em>of</em> virtual environments</strong> focuses on the creation of completely synthetic environments&#8212;the virtual worlds. This approach works well for artistic mediums and entertainment applications. Part <a href="part04.html#part4"><span class="blue">IV</span></a> focuses on creation of content.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.5"></a><strong><span class="font">31.5</span> Objectives</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Objectives</strong> are high-level formalized goals and expected outcomes that focus on benefits and business outcomes over features. Focusing on benefits/outcomes enables the team to work toward the vision and solve problems instead of implementing <a id="page_384"></a>features that users may or may not care about. Features are usually more preferred by engineers as they are easier to implement but may not be what users care about. Yet engineers also do not like to be micromanaged. Thus it is best to let the engineers do what they do best&#8212;solve problems through the use of features they come up with that help to achieve the objectives. The team will gain insight into the value of features as they are being built and tested. If a feature ends up not moving the project toward the objectives, it can be changed, removed, or replaced.</p>
<p class="indent">Benefits that objectives describe often deal with time and/or cost savings, revenue generation, lower safety risks, increase in user productivity, etc. Note that objectives are different than requirements described in Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.15"><span class="blue">31.15</span></a>. Requirements are more specific and often more technical (e.g., latency and tracking requirements).</p>
<p class="indent">Quality objectives include what is described by the acryonym <strong>SMART</strong>&#8212;Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound:</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Specific.</strong> The objective should be clear and unambiguous; state exactly what is expected. The objective might also include specifically why it is important.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Measurable.</strong> The objective should be concrete so that progress toward the goal and ultimately success can be determined in an objective manner. This is essential for the Learn Stage (Chapter <a href="chapter33.html#ch33"><span class="blue">33</span></a>) where measurement and testing occurs.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Achievable.</strong> The objective should somehow be feasible. The description of how is not important here, just the belief that it can be achieved in some manner.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Relevant.</strong> The objective should matter. This does not necessarily directly affect the end result; the objective might support other objectives that do affect the end result.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Time-bound.</strong> An objective should state a date of when it will be completed.</p>
<p class="indentt">An example of an objective is &#8220;The VR training system will be deployed on January 1, 2016, and will result in a 30% increase in productivity as defined in Section X after three sessions of training.&#8221; The 30% productivity goal is a number that can be worked toward before delivery of the system through user testing.</p>
<p class="indent">A long list of objectives may be quite aggressive. Rarely can multiple aggressive goals be achieved in the first delivery nor should they. Prioritize objectives for the first delivery and save other objectives for later delivery. It is better to deliver 50% of the highest-priority objectives than to achieve 50% success on each individual objective.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.6"></a><strong><span class="font">31.6</span> Key Players</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">An important early step is to identify and enroll key players. A <strong>key player</strong> is someone who is essential to the success of the project. Key players might be stakeholders, partners, <a id="page_385"></a>the client or sponsor, government agencies, customers, subject-matter experts, end users, marketing experts, usability experts, consultants, business developers, engineers, etc. It is vital that the core key players are in agreement with the vision, really care about the project, and are committed to achieving success. Identifying and enrolling the <em>right</em> key players can be a huge undertaking in itself. This might include pitching to investors, writing business proposals, assessing client needs, asking for referrals, recruiting others to join the team, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Embracing key players often takes one of two paths.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Enroll others in the vision.</strong> Find key players who are inspired by the vision and believe it can be accomplished, and move on when the individuals are not right for the project. Don&#8217;t waste time on those who are not a good fit. This path is most common when creating an entertainment experience or when recruiting others to join the team. Note that just because an individual or small group originally creates the vision does not mean they should not seek input from enrolled key players.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Help to solve a need.</strong> Identify pain points and work toward finding a way to solve problems and satiate existing desires. This path is common in industry, for example to help reduce costs or find better ways to train employees. Demonstrating <a id="pg385lev1"></a>how you can help individuals (especially the decision makers) with their specific problems makes all the difference in converting skeptics to key players.</p>
<p class="indentt">In both cases, be prepared to do a lot of pitching and proposing. Realize in advance that many people may not have an interest no matter how good of a fit you think they might be. Listen to what they have to say (even if they do not want to be involved they may have valuable input) and then move on. Do not waste time chasing such individuals.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.7"></a><strong><span class="font">31.7</span> Time and Costs</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Accurate estimates are extremely difficult, even for those with extensive project experience. Early estimates should not be expected to be accurate. Because of this, it often makes sense to separate out initial assessment and feasibility from implementation when negotiating contracts. Contracts might also be written with milestones, with the client making additional payment as milestones are achieved and with the expectation that the contract might be renegotiated at each milestone as more is learned and estimates are refined. If a project is late, it is not a good idea to add additional team members as Brooks&#8217; Law states &#8220;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&#8221; [<a href="reference.html#ref36"><span class="blue">Brooks 1995</span></a>]. Because time, budget, and quality are often non-negotiable, the <a id="page_386"></a><a id="pg386lev1"></a>scope of the project may need to be scaled back when a project is taking longer than expected.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="fig31.1"></a><img src="../images/f0386-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 31.1</span> Estimating development is often incorrect at the beginning. It is not uncommon for estimates to be off by a factor of four.</strong> (Based on <a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">Rasmusson</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Planning poker</strong> is a game of estimating development effort [<a href="reference.html#ref47"><span class="blue">Cohn 2005</span></a>]. Although it is best done when planning for implementation, it can also be done at a higher level early in the project with the understanding the estimates will not be as refined since the project is not yet well defined. The team sits at a table, a specific task is stated, and all players write down an estimate of the time they think it will take to complete the task. After secretly writing the estimated time on the card, players face the card down on the table and all cards are flipped right side up. If all estimates are in the same general range, then the average is taken. Planning poker is not a voting system&#8212;three short estimates do not outvote one longer estimate. If there are outliers, then those outliers are discussed. It may be the case that the person who wrote the outlier considered something other team members had not.</p>
<p class="indent">Initial development estimates are often off by as much as 400% [<a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">Rasmusson 2010</span></a>], and developers tend to overestimate their abilities even when they know they tend to overestimate. Estimates improve as implementation continues and more is learned about the project (Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.1"><span class="blue">31.1</span></a>). One way to determine a better estimate is to track the ratio of how long tasks are taking relative to the initial estimate. Future task estimations can be improved by multiplying the tracked ratio by the initial task estimates. <a id="page_387"></a>For example, if tasks estimated to take 5 days actually take 15 days, then the ratio is 3. Future tasks estimated to take 5 days will also likely take 15 days, and tasks estimated to take 10 days will likely take 30 days.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.8"></a><strong><span class="font">31.8</span> Risks</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The intention of identifying risk is to bring awareness of any danger that might affect the project so that appropriate action can be taken to mitigate that risk. After brainstorming with the team on all possible risks, divide the listed risks into two groups: (1) risk the team has influence or control over and (2) risk the team has no influence or control over. Understanding risk that is outside the team&#8217;s control is important for determining if the project is worth pursuing. Once such risk is understood, the leadership must decide to fully commit (or end the project). Then the team can focus on minimizing controllable risk.</p>
<p class="indent">Risk is especially important to be aware of for VR projects because there are so many unknowns and technology is improving so quickly. Risk increases exponentially as project size and duration increases (Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.2"><span class="blue">31.2</span></a>). A two-year project may quickly be put out of business by a new start-up that didn&#8217;t even exist at the beginning of the project. To minimize risk, projects should be kept as short as possible. This does not mean larger projects should not be undertaken. It does mean to break larger projects down into smaller subprojects. After successful completion of the smaller project, then new contracts and extensions can be made.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="fig31.2"></a><a id="pg387lev1"></a><img src="../images/f0387-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 31.2</span> The risk of a VR project failure increases exponentially over time.</strong> (Based on <a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">Rasmusson</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>])</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_388"></a><a id="lev31.9"></a><strong><span class="font">31.9</span> Assumptions</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Assumptions</strong> are high-level declarations of what one or more members of the team believe to be true [<a href="reference.html#ref102"><span class="blue">Gothelf and Seiden 2013</span></a>]. Everything created by humans begins with assumptions, whether the creators consciously realize those assumptions exist or not. VR projects are no different.</p>
<p class="indent">Explicitly looking for and declaring assumptions allows team members to begin a project from a common starting point. Get the team together and carefully go through the project description and dissect its assumptions. The team will likely find that what they assume to be shared assumptions are actually different assumptions. Be bold and precise in listing assumptions, even when not sure. Wrong explicit assumptions are much better than vague assumptions. Wrong assumptions can be tested; vague assumptions cannot [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Examples of assumptions are who the targeted users are, user needs/desires, what the greatest challenges are, what the important VR elements of the experience are, etc. The list of assumptions should be quite long. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to test all assumptions, so prioritize the assumptions with the riskiest assumptions listed first.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.10"></a><a id="pg388lev1"></a><strong><span class="font">31.10</span> Project Constraints</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">All real-world and virtual-world projects have <strong>constraints</strong> that must be designed around. Project constraints can come from a wide range of sources. For example, a constraint might be limited hardware functionality (e.g., tracking may only be reliable within some volume), a maximum amount of accepted latency (e.g., 30 ms is low enough to do prediction fairly well), or budget/time constraints (limiting the complexity of implementation). A single individual should be responsible for tracking/controlling constraints, with transparency to the entire team.</p>
<p class="indent">Project constraints at first seem harmful to what can be done. Whereas it is true that for building a mediocre experience, it is easier to do a general-purpose design with few constraints (e.g., put the user in a world and have him fly around) than to do a special-purpose design [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>]. However, for a high-quality experience, it is easier to do a special-purpose design because establishment of the problem has already started&#8212;it is more a task of discovering constraints. Discovering existing constraints provides clarity and focus resulting in higher-quality experiences that can be more effectively built. Constraints also provide a basis for feedback (i.e., constraints can help focus questions) and challenge the team, stimulating fresh creations.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_389"></a><a id="lev31.10.1"></a><strong><span class="font1">31.10.1</span> Types of Project Constraints</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Explicitly listing project constraints can be very helpful in narrowing the design space. When listing constraints, consider the following [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Real constraints</strong> are true impediments that cannot be changed. Examples include physical barriers, rules outside of the team&#8217;s control, the number of buttons on a specific controller, and the tracked volume of a space.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Resource constraints</strong> are real-world limitations of supply. For any project, there is always at least one scarce resource that must be rationed or budgeted. Examples are dollars, deadlines, minimum hardware specs users are expected to own, end-to-end system latency, and battery life for mobile VR. After listing all possible resource constraints, prioritize them, as there will always be more to do. Some of the low-priority constraints might be moved to misperceived constraints (described below). Track resource constraints with transparency to the entire team, and have a single individual control firmly.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Obsolete constraints</strong> were once real constraints but are no longer valid. This can be due to a change in rules or due to the never-ending improvement of technology. <a id="pg389lev1"></a>Examples include better tracking, faster CPUs, more buttons on a controller, and the number of reliably detected gestures.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Misperceived constraints</strong> are perceived to be real but are not. They are often so embedded in our lives that we don&#8217;t even realize we treat them as constraints. VR is full of misperceived constraints because many of the rules of the real world do not apply to VR. The designer can choose to allow users to walk through walls or reach a greater distance than what can be done in the real world.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Indirect constraints</strong> are the side effects of real constraints. These constraints are not necessarily real constraints as indirect constraints are based on assumptions of how something is achieved. Indirect constraints are important to differentiate because if they are seen as real constraints, then solutions are cut off. The number of polygons for a scene is an indirect constraint. The true constraint is the frame rate as rendering polygons can be optimized.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Intentional artificial constraints</strong> are added by the designer to narrow the design and to enhance the user experience. Adding constraints to a VR experience can significantly improve interaction. Section <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.2.3"><span class="blue">25.2.3</span></a> discusses the power of adding interaction constraints.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 31.3</span> A design puzzle. Draw over all nine dots with four straight lines connected end-to-end. Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.5"><span class="blue">31.5</span></a> shows a solution.</strong></p>

<p class="indent">If you can&#8217;t find a solution, then go through an exercise of explicitly listing the constraints in the points listed above. You may find a solution once you explicitly list all of the different types of constraints. If not, go back and think more carefully about any misperceived constraints. If you are able to do this (and you haven&#8217;t seen the solution before), then congratulations! There are very few people who are able to solve this without first seeing one of the solutions. Did explicitly listing out the constraints (specifically misperceived constraints) help? A reason why most people can&#8217;t solve this puzzle is because most people don&#8217;t take the time to explicitly think about constraints.</p>
<p class="indent">Now try to draw over all nine dots with three straight lines connected end-to-end. (Hint: Think even further outside the box.) Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.7"><span class="blue">31.7</span></a> shows a solution.</p>
<p class="indent">Now try to draw over all nine dots with three straight lines, but this time the lines cannot extend beyond the box boundaries. If you think that is impossible, then go back to your list of constraints and update that which has changed. Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.8"><span class="blue">31.8</span></a> shows a solution.</p>
<p class="indent">Now try to figure out how you could draw over all nine dots with a single straight line. Note that you may be constrained by the tool you are using to solve the problem instead of a constraint inherent to the problem. List any constraints on tools that people normally use to solve such puzzles and then try again. Figure <a href="chapter34.html#fig34.1"><span class="blue">34.1</span></a> shows a solution.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 31.4</span> Persona template.</strong></p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.11"></a><strong><span class="font">31.11</span> Personas</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Attempting to design for the entire population is difficult as users vary widely in their ability to use VR systems, making generalizations difficult [<a href="reference.html#ref337"><span class="blue">Wingrave et al. 2005</span></a>, <a id="pg391lev1"></a><a href="reference.html#ref336"><span class="blue">Wingrave and LaViola 2010</span></a>]. As a result, targeting more specific users makes the design easier. Personas help do this.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Personas</strong> are models of the people who will be using the VR application. Getting clear on users by explicitly defining personas helps to prevent the design from being driven by design/engineering convenience where users are expected to adapt to the system. Not only should the application be defined and designed around these personas, but representative users can be targeted to collect feedback for the Learn Stage (Chapter <a href="chapter33.html#ch33"><span class="blue">33</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Divide a notecard into four quadrants. Start by providing a simple sketch and name in the upper left quadrant. Add a basic description of the person in the upper right quadrant. Add different types of challenges the person has in the lower left quadrant. Then add information about how the person relates to VR in the lower right quadrant. Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.4"><span class="blue">31.4</span></a> shows an example template that might be used. Do this for 3&#8211;4 characters that represent the full range of your targeted users.</p>
<p class="indent">During later iteration cycles, personas should be validated and modified as more is learned about real users. If personas are especially important (e.g., for therapy applications), then data should be collected with interviews (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.3"><span class="blue">33.3.3</span></a>) and/or questionnaires (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.4"><span class="blue">33.3.4</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_392"></a><a id="lev31.12"></a><strong><span class="font">31.12</span> User Stories</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>User stories</strong> emerged from agile development methods and are short concepts or descriptions of features customers would like to see [<a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">Rasmusson 2010</span></a>]. They are often written on small index cards to remind the designer not to go into too much detail. We don&#8217;t know yet if we&#8217;re actually going to need or implement that feature. They are written from the user&#8217;s point of view and should be written with the client and multiple team members.</p>
<p class="indent">User stories are written in the form &#8220;As a &#60;type of user&#62; I want &#60;some goal&#62; so that &#60;some reason&#62;.&#8221; This defines who, what, and why. User stories often turn into requirements and constraints. Break big story items into smaller, manageable stories. Go through the list and clean it up, remove duplicates, group like items together, and turn it into an action item or to-do list.</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, user stories fit with the acronym <strong>INVEST</strong> created by Bill Wake [<a href="reference.html#ref318"><span class="blue">Wake 2003</span></a>]: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.</p>
<p class="hang1"><strong>Independent</strong> user stories are easier to develop for when they do not overlap with other user stories. This means the stories can be implemented in any order and the creation or modification of one story does not affect another story. This can <a id="pg392lev1"></a>be a challenge for VR because interactions often affect other interactions.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Negotiable</strong> user stories are high-level descriptions that are modifiable. VR components must be modifiable because what we think will work well does not always work well, and what works can only be determined by learning from users who actually try the implementations.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Valuable</strong> user stories are specifically focused on giving value to the user and in a language that is understandable by anyone. A brilliantly implemented framework has little value if it does not offer value to users.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Estimable</strong> user stories are understandable so that implementation can be estimated. If the story is too complex, then it should be broken down into easier-to-understand estimable stories.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Small</strong> user stories enable fast implementation. If a story is too big to be quickly implemented, it should be broken down into smaller stories.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Testable</strong> user stories are written so that a simple experiment can clearly determine if the implemented story is working or not.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 31.5</span> A solution to Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.3"><span class="blue">31.3</span></a>. By realizing the surrounding box is a misperceived constraint, one can think outside of the box. Now try doing the same with three straight lines (solution shown in Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.7"><span class="blue">31.7</span></a>).</strong></p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.13"></a><strong><span class="font">31.13</span> Storyboards</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Storyboards</strong> are early visual forms of an experience. They are especially good at getting the point across to those only loosely involved with the project. Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.6"><span class="blue">31.6</span></a> shows an example of a storyboard.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="pg393lev1"></a>Traditional software storyboards typically end up being screenshots more than interactions which are closer to a mock-up than an experience. Storyboards are more useful for VR because the user can be shown directly interacting with objects&#8212;experiences and interactions can be quickly sketched and conveyed without having to worry about screen layout details.</p>
<p class="indent">Storyboarding can, however, be more difficult for VR than for video storyboards because of the non-linear nature of VR. In many other cases there might be multiple connections between storyboard frames.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.14"></a><strong><span class="font">31.14</span> Scope</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When defining the project, explicitly stating what will not be done can be just as helpful as stating what will be done [<a href="reference.html#ref255"><span class="blue">Rasmusson 2010</span></a>]. This will set clear expectations for all involved and allow the team to focus on what is important (Table <a href="chapter31.html#tab31.1"><span class="blue">31.1</span></a>). Items defined to be in scope are what are nonnegotiable and must be completed. The team should explicitly not be concerned with items that are out of scope; they might or might not be included in later releases.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev31.15"></a><strong><span class="font">31.15</span> Requirements</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Requirements</strong> are statements that convey the expectations of the client and/or other key players, such as descriptions of features, capabilities, and quality. Each requirement is a single thing the application should do. Requirements come from other parts of the Define Stage, such as assumptions, constraints, and user stories. Like other parts of the Define Stage, the client and/or other key players should be actively involved in defining requirements. Requirements do not specify implementation.</p>
<p class="indent">Requirements aid with the following.</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; Requirements communicate mutual understanding between the client and contractor, as well as any other parties involved. Requirements should be written in language that can be easily understood by everyone involved with the project.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Requirements help to organize, understand, and decompose goals of the project into more explicit descriptions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Requirements act as input to the design specification (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2"><span class="blue">32.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Requirements are used as a source for determining if a system is working as expected (Chapter <a href="chapter33.html#ch33"><span class="blue">33</span></a>).</p>

<p class="indentt">A requirements document should be as minimal as possible without compromising clarity. Long requirements documentation ends up rarely being read entirely by anyone other than the person writing the document, and that might not even occur due to different groups writing different sections. Not reading the document in its entirety can be a major problem due to key players not being clear on understanding the entire project.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="pg396lev1"></a>Each individual requirement should be complete, verifiable, and concise, yet with room for innovation and change. Requirements may be changed and clarified throughout the project as initially some requirements may be ill-defined and others might become discovered as the project evolves. Not proceeding until all requirements are written down would mean never starting. The Agile Manifesto states, &#8220;Any attempt to formulate all possible requirements at the start of a project will fail and would cause considerable delays&#8221; [<a href="reference.html#ref234"><span class="blue">Pahl et al. 2007</span></a>]. Work with the client and/or other key players when changes are necessary.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev31.15.1"></a><strong><span class="font1">31.15.1</span> Quality Requirements</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Quality requirements</strong> (also known as non-functional requirements) define the overall qualities or attributes of a system or application. Quality requirements can be thought of as a definition for quality of service or quality control. Quality requirements may place restrictions or constraints on the solution, such as usability, aesthetics, security, reliability, and maintainability. Common quality requirements include system requirements, task performance requirements, and usability requirements as described below.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>System requirements</strong> describe parts of the system that are independent of the user, such as accuracy, precision, reliability, latency, and rendering time.</p>
<p class="hangt"><a id="page_397"></a><strong>Accuracy</strong> is the quality or state of being correct (i.e., closeness to the truth). A system with consistent systematic error has bias and low accuracy. For example, distortion in a tracker system has low accuracy because if a user moves in one direction, the tracked point might unexpectedly and wrongly move the tracked point in a different direction.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Precision</strong> is the reproducibility and repeatability of getting the same result. A tracked tool that shakes or jitters in the hand due to bad tracking has low precision and results in difficulty selecting small objects or menu items.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Reliability</strong> is the extent to which some part of the system works consistently (also see Section <a href="chapter27.html#lev27.1.9"><span class="blue">27.1.9</span></a>). It is often measured as a hit rate or failure rate. For example, a tracking system might be required to lose tracking no more than once per 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Latency</strong> is the time a system takes to respond to a user&#8217;s action (Chapter <a href="chapter15.html#ch15"><span class="blue">15</span></a>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Rendering time</strong> is the amount of time it takes for the system to render a single frame. A requirement might be that rendering time not exceed 15 ms for any single frame to ensure frames are not repeated.</p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="pg397lev1"></a>Task performance requirements focus on the effectiveness of interactions. <strong>Task performance</strong> is the measured effectiveness of a task as performed by users, such as time to completion, performance accuracy, performance precision, and training transfer.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Time to completion</strong> is how fast a task can be completed. This is typically measured as the average time it takes for users to complete the task.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Performance accuracy</strong> is the resulting correctness of a user&#8217;s intention. A manipulation or navigation task has decreased accuracy as the distance from the desired position or path increases.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Performance precision</strong> is the consistency of control that users are able to maintain. It can be thought of as the fine-grained control afforded by the technique [<a href="reference.html#ref208"><span class="blue">McMahan et al. 2014</span></a>]. Travel is precise if it enables travel along narrow paths.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Training transfer</strong> is how effectively knowledge and skills obtained through the application transfer to the real world. Training transfer is influenced by many factors such as how well the stimuli and interactions match the real world [<a href="reference.html#ref17"><span class="blue">Bliss et al. 2014</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_398"></a><strong>Usability requirements</strong> describe the quality of the application in terms of convenient and practicable use. Common usability requirements include ease of learning, ease of use, and comfort [<a href="reference.html#ref208"><span class="blue">McMahan et al. 2014</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Ease of learning</strong> is the ease with which a novice user can comprehend and begin to use an application or interaction technique. Ease of learning is often measured by the time it takes a novice to reach some level of performance, or by characterizing performance gains as use increases.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Ease of use</strong> is the simplicity of an application or technique from the user&#8217;s perspective and relates to the amount of mental workload induced upon the user of the technique. Ease of use is typically measured through subjective self-reports, but measures of mental workload are also used.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Comfort</strong> is a state of physical ease and freedom from sickness, fatigue, and pain. Different input devices and interaction techniques can affect user comfort, and making small changes can have a big impact. User comfort is especially important for experiences that are longer than a few minutes. User comfort is typically self-reported.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev31.15.2"></a><strong><span class="font1">31.15.2</span> Functional Requirements</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg398lev1"></a>A <strong>functional requirement</strong> specifies what some part of the system does or what the user can do and often includes a set of inputs, behaviors, and outputs. Functional requirements are typically more dependent on the specifics of the project than quality requirements. Detailed functional requirements often evolve out of task analysis (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.1"><span class="blue">32.1</span></a>) and use cases (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.3"><span class="blue">32.2.3</span></a>). Examples of functional requirements include the following.</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; Computer-controlled characters will navigate to the designated position via the shortest path, where all portions of the path will have (1) a slope between &#8722;20&#176; and 20&#176; and (2) a width greater than 0.8 m.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; All objects marked as selectable will be able to be directly selected by the user via intersecting the hand geometry with the object and pushing the grab button.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Users will not be able to navigate closer to geometry than 0.2 m. in the horizontal when that geometry is at a height between 0.2 m and 2.4 m. above the travel plane.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev31.15.3"></a><strong><span class="font1">31.15.3</span> Universal VR Requirements</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Listed below are some requirements that should be considered for all fully immersive VR applications. These requirements should be achieved and maintained from the <a id="page_399"></a>start of development as optimization can be a challenge late in the project (e.g., reducing scene complexity can require new art assets). The moment these requirements are not being met, the software should automatically and immediately recognize the problem and attempt to resolve the problem by reducing the scene and/or rendering complexity (e.g., transition to simpler lighting algorithms). The less complex settings should then be maintained instead of alternating back and forth as variable latency can cause sickness and prevent adaptation (Section <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.1"><span class="blue">18.1</span></a>). If the requirements still cannot be met, then the scene should <strong>fade out</strong> and/or transition to a simpler scene or video see-through if available (assuming video see-through can achieve the requirements). The fading out of the scene during development will be frustrating to developers but will ensure quality as they will be motivated to fix the problem.</p>

Now try to draw over all nine dots with a single line (solution shown in Figure <a href="chapter34.html#fig34.1"><span class="blue">34.1</span></a>).</strong></p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>End-to-end system delay will not fall below 30 ms.</strong> The scene will automatically fade out if this requirement cannot be maintained.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Minimum frame rate will be the refresh rate of the HMD</strong> (60&#8211;120 Hz depending on the HMD). The scene will automatically fade out if this requirement cannot be maintained.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>The screen will fade out if and when head tracking is lost.</strong> The scene will automatically fade out if this requirement cannot be maintained.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Any camera/viewpoint motion not controlled by the user will not contain accelerations for periods longer than one second.</strong> Such motions should only rarely occur, if ever.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Input devices will maintain 99.99% or better reliability.</strong> Anything less is frustrating to users. Loss of tracking every 10,000 readings at 100 Hz results in lost tracking every 10 seconds.<a id="page_400"></a></p>
