<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">The Basics: Design Guidelines</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">No other technology can cause fear, running, or fleeing in the way that VR can. VR can also induce frustration and anger when things don&#8217;t work, and worse&#8212;even physical sickness if not properly implemented and calibrated. Well-designed VR can produce the awe and excitement of being in a different world, improve performance and cut costs, provide new worlds to experience, improve education, and create better understanding by walking in someone else&#8217;s shoes. With the foundation set in this chapter, the reader can better understand subsequent parts of this book and start creating VR experiences. As VR creators, we have the chance to change the world&#8212;let&#8217;s not blow it through bad design and implementation due to not understanding the basics.</p>
<p class="indent">High-level guidelines for creating VR experiences are provided below.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev5.1"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">5.1</span></span> Introduction and Background (Part <a href="part01.html#part1"><span class="blue">I</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; In order to have a toolbox of options to intelligently choose from, learn the basics of VR, such as the different forms of augmented and virtual reality, different hardware options, ways to present information to the senses, and how to induce presence into the minds of users.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev5.2"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">5.2</span></span> VR Is Communication (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2"><span class="blue">1.2</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on the user experience rather than the technology (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2"><span class="blue">1.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Simplify and harmonize the communication between user and technology (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2"><span class="blue">1.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on making the technical intermediary between the user and content transparent so users feel like they have direct access to the virtual world and its entities (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2.1"><span class="blue">1.2.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_54"></a>&#8226; Design for visceral communication (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2.1"><span class="blue">1.2.1</span></a>) in order to induce presence (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.2"><span class="blue">4.2</span></a>) and inspire awe in users.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev5.3"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">5.3</span></span> An Overview of Various Realities (Chapter <a href="chapter03.html#ch3"><span class="blue">3</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Choose what form of reality you wish to create (Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.1"><span class="blue">3.1</span></a>). Where does it fall on the virtuality continuum?</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Choose what type of input and output hardware to use (Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.2"><span class="blue">3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Understand a VR application is more than just the hardware and technology. Create a strong conceptual story, an interesting design or layout of the environment, and engaging characters (Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.2.8"><span class="blue">3.2.8</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev5.4"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">5.4</span></span> Immersion, Presence, and Reality Trade-Offs (Chapter <a href="chapter04.html#ch4"><span class="blue">4</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Since presence is a function of both immersion and the user, we can&#8217;t entirely control it. Maximize presence by focusing on what we do have control over&#8212;immersion (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.1"><span class="blue">4.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Minimize breaks-in-presence (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.2"><span class="blue">4.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For maximum presence, focus first on world stability and depth cues. Then consider adding physical user interactions, cues of one&#8217;s own body, and social communication (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.3"><span class="blue">4.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Avoid the Uncanny Valley by not trying to make characters appear too close to the way real humans look (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.4.1"><span class="blue">4.4.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Choose what level of representational fidelity, interaction fidelity, and experiential fidelity you want to create (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.4.2"><span class="blue">4.4.2</span></a>).</p>
