<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Motion Sickness</span></h2>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Motion sickness</strong> refers to adverse symptoms and readily available observable signs that are associated with exposure to real and/or apparent motion [<a href="reference.html#ref177"><span class="blue">Lawson 2014</span></a>]. Motion sickness resulting from apparent motion (also known as cybersickness) is the most common negative health effect resulting from VR usage. Symptoms of such sickness include general discomfort, nausea, dizziness, headaches, disorientation, vertigo, drowsiness, pallor, sweating, and, in the occasional worst case, vomiting [<a href="reference.html#ref158"><span class="blue">Kennedy and Lilienthal 1995</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref164"><span class="blue">Kolasinski 1995</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Visually induced motion sickness occurs due to visual motion alone, whereas physically induced motion sickness occurs due to physical motion. Visually induced motion can be stopped by simply closing the eyes, whereas physically induced motion cannot.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="pg163lev1"></a>Travel sickness is a form of motion sickness involving physical motion brought on by traveling in any type of moving vehicle such as a car, boat, or plane. Physically induced motion sickness can also occur from an amusement ride, spinning oneself, or playing on a swing. Although visually induced motion sickness may be similar to physically induced motion sickness, the specific causes and effects can be quite different. For example, vomiting occurs less often from simulator sickness than traditional motion sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref157"><span class="blue">Kennedy et al. 1993</span></a>]. Motion sickness can occur even when the user is not physically moving and results from numerous factors listed in Chapter <a href="chapter15.html#ch15"><span class="blue">15</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter discusses visual scene motion that occurs in VR, how vection relates to motion sickness, theories of motion sickness, and a unified model of motion sickness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev12.1"></a><strong><span class="font">12.1</span> Scene Motion</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Scene motion</strong> is visual motion of the entire virtual environment that would not normally occur in the real world [<a href="reference.html#ref143"><span class="blue">Jerald 2009</span></a>]. A VR scene might be non-stationary due to</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>intentional scene motion</strong> injected into the system in order to make the virtual world behave differently than the real world (e.g., to virtually navigate through the world as discussed in Section <a href="chapter28.html#lev28.3"><span class="blue">28.3</span></a>), and</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_164"></a><strong>unintentional scene motion</strong> caused by shortcomings of technology (where the scene motion often occurs only when moving the head), such as latency or inaccurate calibration (mismatched field of view, optical distortion, tracking error, incorrect interpupiliary distance, etc.).</p>
<p class="indentt">Although intentional scene motion is well defined by code and unintentional scene motion is well defined mathematically [<a href="reference.html#ref2"><span class="blue">Adelstein et al. 2005</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref125"><span class="blue">Holloway 1997</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref143"><span class="blue">Jerald 2009</span></a>], perception of scene motion and how it relates to motion sickness is not as well understood. Researchers do know that noticeable scene motion can degrade a VR experience by causing motion sickness, reducing task performance, lowering visual acuity, and decreasing the sense of presence.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev12.2"></a><strong><span class="font">12.2</span> Motion Sickness and Vection</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Vection (an illusion of self-motion; Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.10"><span class="blue">9.3.10</span></a>) does not necessarily always cause motion sickness. For example, VR often evokes vection when the scene moves at a constant linear velocity, but such motion does not seem to be much of a factor for motion sickness. Yet, when the scene moves in other ways, motion sickness can be a major problem. Why is this the case?</p>
<p class="indent">Visual motion perception takes into account sensation from sensory modalities <a id="pg164lev1"></a>other than just the eyes. When a visual scene moves independently of how a user is physically moving, there can be mismatch between what is seen and what is physically felt. This mismatch is especially discontenting when the virtual motion accelerates because the otolith organs (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.5"><span class="blue">8.5</span></a>) do not sense that same acceleration. The mismatch is not nearly as discontenting when the scene moves with constant velocity because the otolith organs do not sense velocity so there is nothing to compare the visual velocity to. Virtual rotations can be more discontenting because the semicircular canals detect both velocity and acceleration [<a href="reference.html#ref131"><span class="blue">Howard 1986b</span></a>]&#8212;one is more likely to experience motion sickness from constant angular velocity than from constant linear velocity.</p>
<p class="indent">Vection can be a powerful tool in VR to create a sense of travel. However, VR designers should be aware of the consequences of creating such a sense of travel&#8212; particularly linear accelerations of the entire scene and any type of angular motion. Contrary to what one might think would add to presence, adding artificial head bobbing should never be used as this can be significantly sickness inducing. Hill terrain and stairs can also be problematic, although to a lesser extent. Lateral movement can also be a problem, presumably because we do not often strafe in the real world [<a href="reference.html#ref232"><span class="blue"><em>Oculus Best Practices</em> 2015</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Incorrect scene motion also often occurs in VR due to imperfect implementation. Although vestibular stimulation suppresses vection [<a href="reference.html#ref171"><span class="blue">Lackner and Teixeira 1977</span></a>], <a id="page_165"></a>scene motion due to latency and head motion together can still cause vection and is a major contributor to motion sickness. Miscalibrated systems can also result in incorrect scene motion as users move their heads.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev12.3"></a><strong><span class="font">12.3</span> Theories of Motion Sickness</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are several theories as to why motion sickness occurs. When designing and evaluating VR experiences, it is useful to consider all these theories.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.3.1"></a><span class="font1">12.3.1</span> Sensory Conflict Theory</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>sensory conflict theory</strong> [<a href="reference.html#ref258"><span class="blue">Reason and Brand 1975</span></a>] is the most widely accepted explanation for the initiation of motion sickness symptoms [<a href="reference.html#ref113"><span class="blue">Harm 2002</span></a>]. The theory states that motion sickness may result when the environment is altered in such a way that incoming information across sensory modalities (primarily visual and vestibular) are not compatible with each other and do not match our mental model of expectations.</p>
<p class="indent">For VR, visual and auditory cues come from the simulation, whereas vestibular (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.5"><span class="blue">8.5</span></a>) and proprioceptive (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.4"><span class="blue">8.4</span></a>) cues come from body motion in the real world (motion platforms and haptics could be considered both simulation and real <a id="pg165lev1"></a>world). As a result, the visual and auditory synthesized cues are often in disagreement with proprioceptive and vestibular cues, and this disagreement is the primary cause of motion sickness. One of the great challenges of VR is to create visual and auditory cues that are consistent with vestibular and proprioceptive cues in order to minimize motion sickness.</p>
<p class="indent">The two primary conflicts at the root of motion sickness are the visual and vestibular senses; in most VR applications, the visual system senses motion whereas the vestibular does not. For example, when a user pushes forward on a game controller, it may look like she is moving forward but in reality, she is sitting in the same physical position. When these senses are inconsistent, then motion sickness may result.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.3.2"></a><span class="font1">12.3.2</span> Evolutionary Theory</h4>
<p class="noindent">The sensory conflict theory provides an explanation for motion sickness in certain situations, namely, those in which there is a conflict among the senses. However, the theory does not provide an explanation of why motion sickness occurs from an evolutionary point of view.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>evolutionary theory</strong> [<a href="reference.html#ref309"><span class="blue">Treisman 1977</span></a>], also known as the poison theory, offers a reason for why motion makes us sick: it is critical to our survival to properly perceive our body&#8217;s motion and the motion of the world around us. If we get conflicting information from our senses, it means something is not right with our perceptual <a id="page_166"></a>and motor systems. Our bodies have evolved to protect us by minimizing physiological disturbances produced by absorbed toxins. Protection occurs by</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; discouraging movement (e.g., laying down until we recover),</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; ejecting the poison via sweating and vomiting, and</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; causing nausea and malaise (a slight or general feeling of not being healthy or happy) in order to discourage us from ingesting similar toxins in the future.</p>
<p class="indentt">The emetic response associated with motion sickness may occur because the brain interprets sensory mismatch as a sign of intoxication, and triggers a nausea/vomiting defense program to protect itself.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.3.3"></a><span class="font1">12.3.3</span> Postural Instability Theory</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although the sensory conflict theory states that sickness will occur where there is a mismatch between experienced stimuli and expected stimuli, it does not accurately predict which situations will result in a mismatch or how severe sickness will be.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>postural instability theory</strong> predicts that sickness results when an animal lacks or has not yet learned strategies for maintaining postural stability [<a href="reference.html#ref265"><span class="blue">Riccio and Stoffregen 1991</span></a>]. <a id="pg166lev1"></a>Riccio and Stoffregen suggest maintaining posture is one of the major goals of animals, and animals tend to become sick in circumstances where they have not learned strategies to maintain balance. They suggest people need to learn new patterns in novel situations to control their postural stability. Until this learning is completed, sickness may result. They do acknowledge there are sickness problems with sensory stimulation in provocative situations, but argue such problems are caused by (not a cause of) postural instability; i.e., postural instability both precedes motion sickness and is necessary to produce symptoms. Furthermore, they argue the length of time one is unstable and the magnitude of that unstableness are predictors of motion sickness and the intensity of symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent">A person who thinks she is standing still is not completely motionless, but continuously and subconsciously adjusts muscles to provide the best balance. If the wrong muscle control is applied due to perceiving visual motion that is inconsistent with the physicality of the body, then postural instability occurs [<a href="reference.html#ref175"><span class="blue">Laviola 2000</span></a>]. For example, if the visual scene is moving forward, users often lean forward to compensate [<a href="reference.html#ref12"><span class="blue">Badcock et al. 2014</span></a>]. Since the user is standing still instead of moving forward as perceived, then the leaning forward makes the user less stable; postural instability and motion sickness increase.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_167"></a>Getting one&#8217;s &#8220;sea legs&#8221; while traveling by boat to adjust to the boat&#8217;s motion is an example of learning to cope (an adaptive mechanism) with postural stability in the real world. Similarly, VR users learn how to better control posture and balance over time, resulting in less motion sickness.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.3.4"></a><span class="font1">12.3.4</span> Rest Frame Hypothesis</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another criticism of the sensory conflict theory is there are some cue conflicts that do not provoke sickness. The <strong>rest frame hypothesis</strong> states that motion sickness does not arise from conflicting orientation and motion cues directly, but rather from conflicting stationary frames of reference implied by those cues [<a href="reference.html#ref251"><span class="blue">Prothero and Parker 2003</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">The rest frame hypothesis assumes the brain has an internal mental model of which objects are stationary and which are moving. The <strong>rest frame</strong> is the part of the scene that the viewer considers stationary and judges other motion relative to. In the real world, the visual background/context/ground is normally the rest frame. A room one is in is normally considered stationary, so rooms are almost always used as a basis for spatial orientation and motion. It is more intuitive to think about the motion of a ball with respect to a room than it is to think of the room moving with respect to the ball. To perceive motion, the brain first decides which objects are stationary (i.e., the rest frame). Motion of other objects and oneself is then perceived to move relative to this <a id="pg167lev1"></a>rest frame. When new incoming sensory motion cues do not fit the current mental model of the rest frame, motion sickness results. Motion sickness is inextricably tied to one&#8217;s internal mental model of what should be stable.</p>
<p class="indent">Motion between an object and the self can be interpreted as either moving relative to the other. For example, an object moving to the right can also be perceived as the body moving to the left. If the object is considered the rest frame, then it is considered stable and any motion between the object and the self must be due to the self moving, and vection can result.</p>
<p class="indent">The rest frame hypothesis allows for the existence of sensory conflicts without causing motion sickness if those conflicting cues are not essential to the stability of the rest frame. However, if cues that are considered to be part of the rest frame are in conflict, then sickness can result. For example, when a user virtually moves through a world, the ground moves beneath his feet. If the ground is considered the rest frame that does not move, then it must be the user that is moving. Vestibular cues inform the brain that he is not actually moving over the ground, so his mental model of the world becomes confused by the conflicting information and motion sickness results.</p>
<p class="indent">For vision, humans have a bias toward certain things, such as meaningful parts of the scene and background, as being stationary (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.4.2"><span class="blue">20.4.2</span></a>). For example, larger <a id="page_168"></a>backgrounds are considered stable and small stimuli less stable as demonstrated by the autokinetic effect (Section <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2.7"><span class="blue">6.2.7</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indent">VR creators should make rest frame cues consistent whenever possible rather than being overly concerned with making all orientation and all motion consistent. The visuals in VR can be divided into two components: one component being content and the other component being a rest frame that matches the users&#8217; physical inertial environment [<a href="reference.html#ref78"><span class="blue">Duh et al. 2001</span></a>]. For example, since users are heavily influenced by backgrounds to serve as a rest frame, making the background consistent with vestibular cues, even if other parts of the scene move, can reduce motion sickness. Even when the background can&#8217;t be made consistent with vestibular cues, then smaller foreground cues can help to serve as a rest frame. <a href="reference.html#ref129"><span class="blue">Houben and Bos</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref129"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>] created an &#8220;anti-seasickness display&#8221; for use in enclosed ship cabins where no horizon is visible. The display served as an earth-fixed rest frame that matched vestibular cues better than the rest of the room. Subjects experienced less sickness due to ship motion as a result of the display. Such a rest frame can be thought of as an inverse form of augmented reality where real-world spatially fixed visual cues (even if they are computer-generated) that match vestibular cues are brought into the virtual world (vs. adding virtual-world cues into the real world as is done in augmented reality). Such techniques can be used to reduce VR motion sickness as discussed in <a id="pg168lev1"></a>Section <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.2"><span class="blue">18.2</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Motion sickness is much less of an issue for augmented reality optical-see-through HMDs (but not video-see-through HMDS) because users can directly see the real world, which acts as a rest frame consistent with vestibular cues. Motion sickness is also reduced when the real world can be seen in the periphery of the outside edges of an HMD.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.3.5"></a><span class="font1">12.3.5</span> Eye Movement Theory</h4>
<p class="noindent">The eye movement theory states that motion sickness occurs due to the unnatural eye motion required to keep the scene&#8217;s image stable on the retina. If the image moves differently than expected, such as often occurs in VR, then a conflict occurs between what the eyes expect and what actually occurs. The eyes then must move differently than they do in the real world in order to stabilize the image on the retina. As a result of this discrepancy, motion sickness results. See Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.4"><span class="blue">7.4</span></a> for a quick demonstration of how the real world can seem to move, causing a slight sense of vection due to the eye moving by an abnormal method.</p>
<p class="indent">The visual and vestibular systems are strongly connected as demonstrated by gaze-stabilizing eye movements that result from the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and <a id="page_169"></a>visual suppression of the VOR through the optokinetic reflex (OKR) (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.1.5"><span class="blue">8.1.5</span></a>). Optokinetic nystagmus has been proposed [<a href="reference.html#ref80"><span class="blue">Ebenholtz et al. 1994</span></a>] to affect the vagal nerve, a mixed nerve that contains both sensory and motor neurons [<a href="reference.html#ref284"><span class="blue">Siegel and Sapru 2014</span></a>]. Such innervations lead to nausea and emesis.</p>
<p class="indent">Studies have shown that when observers fixate on a point to reduce eye movement induced by larger moving stimuli (i.e., reduction of optokinetic nystagmus, also discussed in Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.1.5"><span class="blue">8.1.5</span></a>), then vection is enhanced. Such a stationary fixation point may also result in users selecting that point as a rest frame [<a href="reference.html#ref160"><span class="blue">Keshavarz et al. 2014</span></a>]. Thus, supplying fixation points for VR users to focus upon and maintain eye stability may help to reduce motion sickness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev12.4"></a><strong><span class="font">12.4</span> A Unified Model of Motion Sickness</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This section describes a unified model of motion perception and motion sickness that includes the true state of the world and self; sensory input; the estimated state of the world and self; actions; afferent and efferent signals; and the internal mental model of the individual [<a href="reference.html#ref256"><span class="blue">Razzaque 2005</span></a>]. Integrating these various components together is not just important for perceiving motion but is critical for survival, navigation, balance/posture, and stabilizing the eyes so they function properly. The model is <a id="pg169lev1"></a>consistent with all the previously described theories of motion sickness and can be used to help understand how we perceive motion, whether that motion is perceived as external motion of the world or self-motion, and why motion sickness results. Figure <a href="chapter12.html#fig12.1"><span class="blue">12.1</span></a> shows the relationship of the various components, which are discussed below.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.4.1"></a><span class="font1">12.4.1</span> The True State of the World</h4>
<p class="noindent">The &#8220;truth&#8221; of the world (which includes oneself) at any given moment can be considered a state describing everything in it. For this model, the state is the objective motion between the external world (distal stimuli) and the physical self.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.4.2"></a><span class="font1">12.4.2</span> Sensory Input</h4>
<p class="noindent">A person&#8217;s perception of motion is largely a function of information coming in through multiple senses (proximal stimuli transduced into afferent nerve impulses). Humans rely on visual, auditory, vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile information in order to maintain balance and orientation, and to distinguish self-motion from external motion.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_170"></a><a id="fig12.1"></a><img src="../images/f0170-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 12.1</span> A unified model of motion perception and motion sickness.</strong> (Adapted from <a href="reference.html#ref256"><span class="blue">Razzaque</span></a> <a id="pg170lev1"></a>[<a href="reference.html#ref256"><span class="blue">2005</span></a>])</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.4.3"></a><span class="font1">12.4.3</span> Central Processing</h4>
<p class="noindent">Brain processes integrate information from multiple senses to perceive what is happening (bottom-up processing). Any single sensory modality has limitations, so the brain integrates information from multiple senses together to form a better estimate of the world and the self. In fact, even information from all the senses is not enough (and sometimes not consistent) to accurately estimate both. Thus, additional input to central processing is needed. Additional input comes from an internal mental model (top-down processing) as well as prediction of sensory input from one&#8217;s own actions (efference copy).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.4.4"></a><span class="font1">12.4.4</span> State Estimation</h4>
<p class="noindent">At any given moment, the brain contains an estimate of the world and the self. Interaction among the various sensory cues helps to disambiguate whether motion is a result of the world moving or the self moving through that world. One&#8217;s estimate of this motion is constantly tested and revised as a function of central processing. A state estimate that is incorrect can result in visual illusions such as vection. An <a id="page_171"></a>inconsistent or unstable state estimate (e.g., vestibular cues do not match visual cues) can result in motion sickness. If the state estimate changes to be consistent with itself even though input has not changed, then perceptual adaptation (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.2"><span class="blue">10.2.2</span></a>) has occurred. The state estimate includes not only what is currently happening but what is likely to happen.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.4.5"></a><span class="font1">12.4.5</span> Actions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The body continuously attempts to self-correct through physical actions in order to fit its state estimate. Several physical actions can occur when attempting to self-correct: (1) one attempts to stabilize himself by changing posture, (2) the eyes rotate to try to stabilize the virtual world&#8217;s unstable image on the retina through the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes, and (3) physiological responses occur, such as sweating and, in extreme cases, vomiting, to remove what the body thinks may be toxins causing the confused state estimate.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the mind and body have learned or adapted to new ways of taking action (e.g., a new navigation technique), then action, prediction, feedback, and the mental model become more consistent resulting in less motion sickness.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev12.4.6"></a><a id="pg171lev1"></a><span class="font1">12.4.6</span> Prediction and Feedback</h4>
<p class="noindent">The perception of a visually stable world relies on prediction of how incoming sensory information will change due to one&#8217;s action. For example, as one turns the head and eyes to the left, then copies of outgoing efferent nerve signals (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.4"><span class="blue">7.4</span></a>) are sent to central processing that predict a left vestibular response, left-turning neck proprioception, and optical flow moving to the right. If this efference copy matches incoming afferent signals from the senses, then the mind perceives any changes as coming from one&#8217;s own actions (the afferent signals are then called re-afference since the afference reconfirms that the intended action has taken place). If the efference copy and afference do not match, then the observer perceives the stimulus to have occurred from a change in the external world (e.g., the entire world appears to move in a strange way) instead of from one&#8217;s actions.</p>
<p class="indent">At a higher level, drivers and pilots who control their vehicle motion rarely exhibit motion sickness although the same individuals sometimes report motion sickness when they are passengers [<a href="reference.html#ref271"><span class="blue">Rolnick and Lubow 1991</span></a>]. Such results are consistent with voluntary active movement initiating perceptual processes differently than passive movements (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.4"><span class="blue">10.4</span></a>) and re-afferent feedback. Similar to driving, VR users are less likely to get sick if they actively control their viewpoint.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_172"></a><a id="lev12.4.7"></a><span class="font1">12.4.7</span> Mental Model of Motion</h4>
<p class="noindent">Afference and efference are not perfect and cannot completely explain position constancy and self-motion. There is noise in muscles, external forces sometimes constrain motion, eye saccades cannot be completely predicted, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Each of us has an internal mental model (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a>) of how the world works based on previous experience and future expectations. New incoming information is evaluated in terms of this model, rather than continuously constructing new models from scratch. When new information does not match the model, then disorientation and confusion can result. A part of a person&#8217;s mental model is transient; the mental model is often reevaluated and relearned. Other parts are more permanent/hardwired assumptions. For example, larger and further-away objects are more likely to be perceived as a rest frame, which can result in induced motion (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.5"><span class="blue">9.3.5</span></a>) of smaller objects when the larger, further-away objects are in fact not stationary. Another assumption is consistency&#8212;one assumes object properties (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.1"><span class="blue">10.1</span></a>) do not change over a short period of time. Breaking these assumptions can lead to strong illusions, even when one cognitively knows exactly which assumptions are false; the perceptual system does not always agree with the rational thinking cortex [<a href="reference.html#ref105"><span class="blue">Gregory 1973</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">The internal mental model has expectations of how one&#8217;s actions will affect the world and how stimuli will move. When one acts, the new incoming perceptual cues, <a id="pg172lev1"></a>efference copy, and mental model are all compared, and the mental model is verified, refined, or invalidated. This is consistent with the rest frame hypothesis&#8212;when the mental motion model is invalidated by new sensory cues, the rest frame seems to move and motion sickness can result.</p>
