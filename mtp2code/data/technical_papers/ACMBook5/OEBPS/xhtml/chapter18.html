<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Examples of Reducing Adverse Effects</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">This chapter provides several examples of reducing sickness based off of previous chapters. The intention is not only that these examples be used, but that they serve as motivation for understanding the theoretical aspects of VR sickness so that new methods and techniques can be created.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.1"></a><strong><span class="font">18.1</span> Optimize Adaptation</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg207lev1"></a>Since visual and perceptual-motor systems are modifiable, sickness can be reduced through dual adaptation (Sections <span class="blue">10.2</span> and <span class="blue">13.4.1</span>). Fortunately, most people are able to adapt to VR, and the more one has adapted to VR the less she will get sick [<a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>]. Of course, adaptation does not occur immediately and adaptation time depends on the type of discrepancy [<a href="reference.html#ref327"><span class="blue">Welch 1986</span></a>] and the individual. Individuals who adapt quickly might not experience any sickness whereas those who are slower to adapt may become sick and give up before completely adapting [<a href="reference.html#page_556"><span class="blue">McCauley and Sharkey 1992</span></a>]. Incremental exposure and progressively increasing the intensity of stimulation over multiple exposures is a very effective way to reduce motion sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref170"><span class="blue">Lackner 2014</span></a>]. To maximize adaptation, sessions should be spaced 2&#8211;5 days apart [<a href="reference.html#ref295"><span class="blue">Stanney et al. 2014</span>, <span class="blue">Lawson 2014</span>, <span class="blue">Kennedy et al. 1993</span></a>]. In addition to verbally and textually telling novice users to make only slow head motions, they can also be more subtly encouraged to do so through relaxing/soothing environments. Latency should also be kept constant to maximize the chance of temporal adaptation (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.2"><span class="blue">10.2.2</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.2"></a><strong><span class="font">18.2</span> Real-World Stabilized Cues</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Seasickness and car sickness are triggered by the motion of the vehicle. When one looks at something that is stable within the vehicle, such as a book when reading, visual cues imply no movement, but the motion of the vehicle stimulates the vestibular system implying there is movement. Vection can be thought of as the inverse of this&#8212;the eyes see movement, but the vestibular system is not stimulated. Although inverses of each other, visual and vestibular cues are in conflict in both cases, and as a result similar sickness often occurs.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking out the window in a car, or at the horizon in a boat, results in seeing visual motion cues that match vestibular cues. Since vestibular-ocular cues are no longer in conflict, motion sickness is dramatically reduced. Inversely, motion sickness can be reduced by adding stable visual cues to virtual environments (assuming low latency and the system is well calibrated) that act as a rest frame (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.4"><span class="blue">12.3.4</span></a>). A cockpit that is stable relative to the real world substantially reduces motion sickness. The virtual world outside the cockpit might change as one navigates their vehicle through space, but the local vehicle interior is stable relative to the real world and the user (Figure <a href="chapter18.html#fig18.1"><span class="blue">18.1</span></a>). Visual cues that stay stable relative to the real world and the user but are not a full cockpit can also be used to help the user feel more stabilized in space and reduce motion sickness. Figure <a href="chapter18.html#fig18.2"><span class="blue">18.2</span></a> shows an example&#8212;the blue arrows are stable relative to the real world no matter how the user virtually turns or walks through the environment. Another example is a stabilized bubble with markings surrounding the user.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 18.2</span> For a well-calibrated system with low latency, the blue arrows are stationary relative to the real world and are consistent with vestibular cues even as the user virtually turns or walks around. In this case, the blue arrows also serve to indicate which way the forward direction is.</strong> (Courtesy of NextGen Interactions)</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.3"></a><strong><span class="font">18.3</span> Manipulate the World as an Object</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Although quite different than how the real world works, 3D Multi-Touch (Section <a href="chapter28.html#lev28.3.3"><span class="blue">28.3.3</span></a>) enables users to push, pull, turn, and stretch the viewpoint with their hands. Such viewpoint control can be thought about and perceived in two subtly different but important ways:</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; <em>self-motion</em>, where the user pulls himself through the world, or</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; <em>world motion</em>, where the user pushes and pulls the world as if it were an object.</p>
<p class="indentt">While these two alternatives are technically equivalent in terms of relative movement between the user and the world, anecdotal evidence suggests the latter way of thinking can alleviate motion sickness. When the user thinks about viewpoint movement in terms of manipulating the world as an object from a stationary vantage point (i.e., the user considers gravity and the body to be the rest frame), the mind less expects the vestibular system to be stimulated. In fact, Paul Mlyniec (personal communication, April 28, 2015) claims &#8220;at least in the absence of roll and pitch, there is no more visual-vestibular conflict than if a user picked up a large object in the real world.&#8221; Maintaining a mental model of the world being an object can be a challenge for some <a id="page_210"></a>users, so visual cues that help with that mental model are important. For example, the center point of rotation and/or scaling at the midpoint between the hands can be important to help users more easily predict motion and give them a sense of direct and active control. Constraints can also be added for novice users. For example, keeping the world vertically upright can help to increase control and reduce disorientation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.4"></a><strong><span class="font">18.4</span> Leading Indicators</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When a pre-planned travel path must be used, adding cues that help users to reliably predict how the viewpoint will change in the near future can help to compensate for disturbances. This is known as a <strong>leading indicator.</strong> For example, adding an indicator object that leads a passive user by 500 ms along a motion trajectory of a virtual scene (similar to a driver following another car when driving) alleviates motion sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref183"><span class="blue">Lin et al. 2004</span></a>].</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.5"></a><strong><span class="font">18.5</span> Minimize Visual Accelerations and Rotations</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg210lev1"></a>Constant visual velocity (e.g., virtually moving straight ahead at a constant speed) is not a major contributor to motion sickness due to the vestibular organs not being able to detect linear velocity. However, visual accelerations (e.g., transitioning from no virtual movement to virtually moving in the forward direction) can be more of a problem and should be minimized (assuming a motion platform is not being used). If the design requires visual acceleration, the acceleration should be infrequent and occur as quickly as possible. For example, when transitioning from a stable position to some constant velocity, the period of acceleration to the constant velocity should occur quickly. Change in direction while moving, even when speed is kept constant, is a form of acceleration although it&#8217;s not clear if change in direction is as sickness inducing as forward linear acceleration.</p>
<p class="indent">Minimizing accelerations and rotations is especially important for passive motion where the user is not actively controlling the viewpoint (e.g., immersive film where the capture point is moving). Slower orientation changes do not seem to be nearly as much of a problem as faster orientation changes. For real-world panoramic capture (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.6.1"><span class="blue">21.6.1</span></a>), unless the camera can be carefully controlled and tested for small comfortable motions, the camera should only be moved with constant linear velocity, if moved at all. Likewise, for computer-generated scenes, the user&#8217;s viewpoint should not be attached to the user&#8217;s own avatar head when it is possible for the system to affect the avatar&#8217;s head pose (e.g., from a physics simulation).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_211"></a>Visual accelerations are less of a problem when the user actively controls the viewpoint (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.4.6"><span class="blue">12.4.6</span></a>) but can still be nauseating. When using the analog sticks on a gamepad or using other steering technique (Section <a href="chapter28.html#lev28.3.2"><span class="blue">28.3.2</span></a>), it is best to have discrete speeds and the transition between those speeds to occur quickly.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, there are no published numbers as to what is acceptable for VR. VR creators should perform extensive testing across multiple users (particularly users new to VR) to determine what is comfortable with their specific implementation.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.6"></a><strong><span class="font">18.6</span> Ratcheting</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Denny Unger (personal communication, March 26, 2015) has found that discrete virtual turns (e.g., instantaneous turns of 30&#176;) he calls <strong>ratcheting</strong> result in far fewer reports of sickness compared to smooth virtual turns. This technique results in breaks-in-presence and can feel very strange when one is not accustomed to it, but can be worth the reduction in sickness. Interestingly, not just any angles work. Denny had to experiment and fine-tune the rotation until he reached 30&#176;. Rotation by other amounts turned out to be more sickness inducing.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="pg211lev1"></a><a id="lev18.7"></a><strong><span class="font">18.7</span> Delay Compensation</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Because computation is not instantaneous, VR will always have delay. <strong>Delay compensation techniques</strong> can reduce the deleterious effects of system delay, effectively reducing latency [<a href="reference.html#ref143"><span class="blue">Jerald 2009</span></a>]. Prediction and some post-rendering techniques are described below. These can be used together by first predicting and then correcting any error of that prediction with a post-rendering technique.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev18.7.1"></a><strong><span class="font1">18.7.1</span> Prediction</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Head-motion prediction</strong> is a commonly used delay compensation technique for HMD systems. Prediction produces reasonable results for low system delays or slow head movements. However, prediction increases motion overshoot and amplifies sensor noise [<a href="reference.html#ref11"><span class="blue">Azuma and Bishop 1995</span></a>]. Displacement error increases with the square of the angular head frequency and the square of the prediction interval. Predicting for more than 30 ms can be more detrimental than doing no prediction for fast head motions. Furthermore, prediction is incapable of compensating for rapid transients.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev18.7.2"></a><strong><span class="font1">18.7.2</span> Post-rendering Techniques</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Post-rendering latency reduction</strong> techniques first render to geometry larger than the final display and then, late in the display process, select the appropriate subset to be presented to the user.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_212"></a>The simplest post-rendering latency reduction technique is accomplished via a <strong>2D warp</strong> (what Oculus calls time warping; <span class="blue">Carmack 2015</span>). As done in standard rendering, the system first renders the scene to a single image plane. The pixels are then selected from the larger image plane or reprojected according to the newly desired viewing parameters just before the pixels are displayed [<a href="reference.html#ref145"><span class="blue">Jerald et al. 2007</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">A cylindrical panorama, as in Quicktime VR [<a href="reference.html#ref45"><span class="blue">Chen 1995</span></a>], or spherical panorama can be used, instead of a single image plane, to remove error due to rotation. However, rendering to a panorama or sphere is computationally expensive, because standard graphics pipelines are not optimized to render to such surfaces.</p>
<p class="indent">A compromise between a single image plane and a spherical panorama is a <strong>cubic environment map.</strong> This technique extends the image plane technique by rendering the scene onto the six sides of a large cube [<a href="reference.html#ref104"><span class="blue">Greene 1986</span></a>]. Head rotation simply alters what part of display memory is accessed&#8212;no other computation is required.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="reference.html#ref262"><span class="blue">Regan and Pose</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref262"><span class="blue">1994</span></a>] took environment mapping further by projecting geometry onto concentric cubes surrounding the viewpoint. Larger cubes that contain projected geometry far from the viewpoint do not require re-rendering as often as smaller cubes that are close to the viewpoint. However, in order to minimize error due to large translations or close objects, a full 3D warp [<a href="reference.html#ref198"><span class="blue">Mark et al. 1997</span></a>] or a pre-computed light <a id="pg212lev1"></a>field [<a href="reference.html#ref260"><span class="blue">Regan et al. 1999</span></a>] is required, although such techniques do produce other types of visual artifacts.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev18.7.3"></a><strong><span class="font1">18.7.3</span> Problems of Delay Compensation</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">None of the delay compensation techniques described above are perfect. For example, 2D warping a single image plane minimizes error at the center of the display, but error increases toward the periphery [<a href="reference.html#ref145"><span class="blue">Jerald et al. 2007</span></a>]. Ultra-wide-field-of-view HMDs may especially be a problem due to this peripheral error that results in incorrect motion as the head turns and the mind&#8217;s sensitivity to motion in the periphery. Cubic environment mapping helps by reducing error in the periphery, but such techniques only compensate for rotations, and natural head rotations include some motion parallax. Thus, visual artifacts are worse the closer geometry is to the viewpoint. Furthermore, many latency compensation techniques assume the scene is static; object motion is often not corrected for. Regardless, most latency compensation techniques, if implemented well, can reduce error with visual artifacts being less detrimental than with no correction.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.8"></a><strong><span class="font">18.8</span> Motion Platforms</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Motion platforms (Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.2.4"><span class="blue">3.2.4</span></a>), if implemented well, can help to reduce simulator sickness by reducing the inconsistency between vestibular and visual cues. However, <a id="page_213"></a>motion platforms do add a risk of increasing motion sickness by (1) causing incongruency between the physical motion and visual motion (the primary cause), and (2) increasing physically induced motion sickness independent of how visuals move (a lesser cause). Thus motion platforms are not a quick fix for reducing motion sickness&#8212;they must be carefully integrated as part of the design.</p>
<p class="indent">Even passive motion platforms (Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.2.4"><span class="blue">3.2.4</span></a>) can reduce sickness (Max Rheiner, personal communication, May 3, 2015). Birdly by Somniacs (Figure <a href="chapter03.html#fig3.14"><span class="blue">3.14</span></a>) is a flying simulation where the user becomes a bird flying above San Francisco. The user controls the tilt of the platform by leaning. The active control of flying with the arms also helps to reduce motion sickness. Motion sickness is further reduced because the user is lying down, so less postural instability occurs than if the user were standing.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.9"></a><strong><span class="font">18.9</span> Reducing Gorilla Arm</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Using VR devices can become tiresome after extended use due to holding the controllers out and in front of the user (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.1"><span class="blue">14.1</span></a>). However, when the interaction is designed so users can mostly interact with their hands in a relaxed manner at their sides and/or in their laps, then they can interact for several hours at a time without experiencing gorilla arm [<a href="reference.html#ref147"><span class="blue">Jerald et al. 2013</span></a>].</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="pg213lev1"></a><a id="lev18.10"></a><strong><span class="font">18.10</span> Warning Grids and Fade-Outs</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">For a user approaching the edge of tracking, a real-world physical object not visually represented in the virtual world (e.g., a wall), or the edge of a safe zone, a <strong>warning grid</strong> (Figure <a href="chapter18.html#fig18.3"><span class="blue">18.3</span></a>) or the real world can fade in to provide a cue to the user that he should back off. Whereas such feedback can cause a break-in-presence, it is better than the alternative of the loss of quality tracking that results in a worse break-in-presence and injury.</p>
<p class="indent">Once tracking is no longer solid or latency exceeds some value, the system should quickly <strong>fade out</strong> the display to a single color to prevent motion sickness. Such problems are most easily detected by detecting tracking jitter or a decreased frame rate. Alternatively, for systems with low-latency video-see-through capability, the system can quickly fade in the real world.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev18.11"></a><strong><span class="font">18.11</span> Medication</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Anti-motion-sickness medication can potentially enhance the rate of adaptation by allowing progressive exposure to higher levels of stimulation without symptoms being elicited. Unfortunately, many of the various medications that have been developed to minimize motion sickness lead to serious side effects that dramatically restrict their field of application [<a href="reference.html#ref160"><span class="blue">Keshavarz et al. 2014</span></a>].</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 18.3</span> A warning grid can be used to inform the user he is nearing the edge of tracked space or approaching a physical barrier/risk.</strong> (Courtesy of Sixense)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="pg214lev1"></a>Ginger has also been touted as a remedy, but its effects are marginal [<a href="reference.html#ref170"><span class="blue">Lackner 2014</span></a>]. Relaxation feedback training has been used in conjunction with incremental exposure to increasingly provocative stimulation as a way of decreasing susceptibility to VR sickness.</p>
<p class="indent">In drug studies of motion sickness, there are usually large benefits of placebo effects, typically in the 10%&#8211;40% range of the drug effects. Wrist acupressure bands and magnets sold to &#8220;alleviate&#8221; or prevent motion sickness could potentially provide placebo benefits for some people.</p>
