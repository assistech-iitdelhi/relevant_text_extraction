<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">What Is Virtual Reality?</span></h2>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev1.1"></a><span class="font">1.1</span> The Definition of Virtual Reality</h3>
<p class="noindent">The term virtual reality (VR) is commonly used by the popular media to describe imaginary worlds that only exist in computers and our minds. However, let us more precisely define the term. <a href="reference.html#ref282"><span class="blue">Sherman and Craig</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref282"><span class="blue">2003</span></a>] point out in their book <em>Understanding Virtual Reality</em> that <em><a href="reference.html#ref325"><span class="blue">Webster&#8217;s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary</span></a></em> [<a href="reference.html#ref325"><span class="blue">1989</span></a>] defines virtual <a id="pg9lev1"></a>as &#8220;being in essence or effect, but not in fact&#8221; and reality as &#8220;the state or quality of being real. Something that exists independently of ideas concerning it. Something that constitutes a real or actual thing as distinguished from something that is merely apparent.&#8221; Thus, virtual reality is a term that contradicts itself&#8212;an oxymoron! Fortunately, the website <a href="reference.html#ref213"><span class="blue">merriam-webster.com</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref213"><span class="blue">Merriam-Webster 2015</span></a>] has more recently defined the full term virtual reality to be &#8220;an artificial environment which is experienced through sensory stimuli (as sights and sounds) provided by a computer and in which one&#8217;s actions partially determine what happens in the environment.&#8221; In this book, <strong>virtual reality</strong> is defined to be a computer-generated digital environment that can be experienced and interacted with as if that environment were real.</p>
<p class="indent">An ideal VR system enables users to physically walk around objects and touch those objects as if they were real. Ivan Sutherland, the creator of one of the world&#8217;s first VR systems in the 1960s, stated [<a href="reference.html#ref302"><span class="blue">Sutherland 1965</span></a>]: &#8220;The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal.&#8221; We haven&#8217;t yet come anywhere near Ivan Sutherland&#8217;s vision (nor do we necessarily want to!) and perhaps we never will. However, there are some quite engaging virtual realities today&#8212;many of which are featured throughout this book.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_10"></a><a id="lev1.2"></a><span class="font">1.2</span> VR Is Communication</h3>
<p class="noindent">Normally, communication is thought of as interaction between two or more people. This book defines <strong>communication</strong> more abstractly: the transfer of energy between two entities, even if just the cause and effect of one object colliding with another object. Communication can also be between human and technology&#8212;an essential component and basis of VR. VR design is concerned with the communication of how the virtual world works, how that world and its objects are controlled, and the relationship between user and content: ideally where users are focused on the experience rather than the technology.</p>
<p class="indent">Well-designed VR experiences can be thought of as collaboration between human and machine where both software and hardware work harmoniously together to provide intuitive communication with the human. Developers write complex software to create, if designed well, seemingly simple transfer functions to provide effective interactions and engaging experiences. Communication can be broken down into direct communication and indirect communication as discussed below.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev1.2.1"></a><span class="font1">1.2.1</span> Direct Communication</h4>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg10lev1"></a><strong>Direct communication</strong> is the direct transfer of energy between two entities with no intermediary and no interpretation attached. In the real world, pure direct communication between entities doesn&#8217;t represent anything as the purpose is not communication, but it is a side effect. However, in VR, developers insert an artificial intermediary (the VR system that is ideally unperceivable) between the user and carefully controlled sensory stimuli (e.g., shapes, motions, sounds). When the goal is direct communication, VR creators should focus on making the intermediary transparent so users feel like they have direct access to those entities. If that can be achieved, then users will perceive, interpret, and interact with stimuli as if they are directly communicating with the virtual world and its entities.</p>
<p class="indent">Direct communication consists of structural communication and visceral communication.</p>
<h5 class="h5">Structural Communication</h5>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Structural communication</strong> is the physics of the world, not the description or the mathematical representation but the thing-in-itself [<a href="reference.html#ref154"><span class="blue">Kant 1781</span></a>]. An example of structural communication is the bouncing of a ball off of the hand. We are always in relationship to objects, which help to define our state; e.g., the shape of our hand around a controller. The world, as well as our own bodies, directly tells us what the structure is through our senses. Although thinking and feeling do not exist within structural <a id="page_11"></a>communication, such communication does provide the starting point for perception, interpretation, thinking, and feeling.</p>
<p class="indent">In order for our ideas to persist through time, we must put those ideas into structural form, what <a href="reference.html#ref230"><span class="blue">Norman</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref230"><span class="blue">2013</span></a>] calls knowledge in the world. Recorded information and data is the obvious example of structural form, but sometimes less obvious structural forms are the signifiers and constraints (Section <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.1"><span class="blue">25.1</span></a>) of interaction. In order to induce experiences into others through VR, we present structural stimuli (e.g., pixels on a display, sound through headphones, or the rumble/vibration of a controller) so the users can sense and interact with our creations.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Visceral Communication</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Visceral communication</strong> is the language of automatic emotion and primal behavior, not the rational representation of the emotions and behavior (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.7"><span class="blue">7.7</span></a>). Visceral communication is always present for humans and is the in-between of structural communication and indirect communication. Presence (Chapter <a href="chapter04.html#ch4"><span class="blue">4</span></a>) is the act of being fully engaged via direct communication (albeit primarily one way). Examples of visceral communication are the feeling of awe while sitting on a mountaintop, looking down <a id="pg11lev1"></a>at the earth from space, or being with someone via solid eye contact (whether in the real world or via avatars in VR). The full experience of such visceral communication cannot be put into words, although we often attempt to do so at which point the experience is transformed into indirect communication (e.g., explaining VR to someone is not the same as experiencing VR).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev1.2.2"></a><span class="font1">1.2.2</span> Indirect Communication</h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Indirect communication</strong> connects two or more entities through some intermediary. The intermediary need not be physical; in fact, the intermediary is often our mind&#8217;s interpretation that sits between the world and behavior/action. Once we interpret and give something meaning, then we have transformed the direct communication into indirect communication. Indirect communication includes what we normally think of as language, such as spoken and written language, as well as sign languages and our internal thoughts (i.e., communicating with oneself). Indirect communication consists of talking, understanding, creating stories/histories, giving meaning, comparing, negating, fantasizing, lying, and romancing. These are not part of the objective real world but are what we humans describe and create with our minds. Indirect VR communication includes the user&#8217;s internal mental model (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a>) of how the VR world works (e.g., the interpretation of what is occurring in the VR world), and indirect interactions (Section <a href="chapter28.html#lev28.4"><span class="blue">28.4</span></a>) such as moving a slider that changes an object property, <a id="page_12"></a>speech recognition that changes the system&#8217;s state, and indirect gestures that act as a sign language to the computer.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev1.3"></a><span class="font">1.3</span> What Is VR Good For?</h3>
<p class="noindent">The recent surge in media coverage about VR has inspired the public to become quite excited about its potential. This coverage has focused on the entertainment industry, specifically video games and immersive film. VR is a great fit for the entertainment industry and will certainly be the driving force behind VR in the short term. However, what is VR good for beyond entertainment? It turns out VR can have enormous benefit over a wide range of verticals. VR has been successfully deployed in various industries for many years now. Successful applications include oil and gas exploration, scientific visualization, architecture, flight simulation, therapy, military training, theme-park entertainment, engineering analysis, and design review. Using VR in such situations has successfully revealed costly design mistakes before manufacturing anything, reduced time to market by speeding up iterative processes, provided safe learning environments that would otherwise be dangerous, reduced PTSD by gradually increasing exposure to feared stimuli, and helped to visualize large datasets that would be difficult <a id="pg12lev1"></a>to comprehend with traditional systems.</p>
<p class="indent">Unfortunately, to date, VR has largely been limited to well-funded academic and corporate research labs to which few have access. That is all changing with consumer-priced systems now becoming widely available. The VR market is expected to first explode in the entertainment industry but will soon expand significantly in other industries. Education, telepresence, and professional training will likely be the next industries to take advantage of VR in a big way.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the industry, VR is largely about providing understanding&#8212;whether that is understanding an entertaining story, learning an abstract concept, or practicing a real skill. Actively using more of the human sensory capability and motor skills has been known to increase understanding/learning for some time [<a href="reference.html#ref61"><span class="blue">Dale 1969</span></a>]. This is in part due to the increased sensory bandwidth between human and information, but there is much more to understanding. Actively participating in an action, making concepts intuitive, encouraging motivation through engaging experiences, and the thoughts inside one&#8217;s head all contribute to understanding. This book focuses on how to design such concepts into VR experiences.</p>
<p class="indent">Figure <a href="chapter01.html#fig1.1"><span class="blue">1.1</span></a> shows Edgar Dale&#8217;s Cone of Experience [<a href="reference.html#ref61"><span class="blue">Dale 1969</span></a>]. As can be seen in the figure, direct purposeful experiences provide the best basis for understanding. As Confucius stated, &#8220;I see and I forget. I hear and I remember. I do and I understand.&#8221; Note this diagram does not suggest direct purposeful experiences should be <a id="pg13lev1"></a>the only method of learning, but instead describes the progression of learning experience. Adding other indirect information within direct purposeful VR experiences can further enhance understanding. For example, embedding abstract information such as text, symbols, and multimedia directly into the scene and onto virtual objects can lead to more efficient understanding than what can be achieved in the real world.</p>
