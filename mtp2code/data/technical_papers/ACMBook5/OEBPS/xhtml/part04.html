<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>CONTENT CREATION</strong></h2>
<p class="chblock"><em>We graphicists choreograph colored dots on a glass bottle so as to fool eye and mind <a id="pg223lev1"></a>into seeing desktops, spacecraft, molecules, and worlds that are not and never can be</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. (<a href="reference.html#ref32"><span class="blue">1988</span></a>)</p>
<p class="indent">Humans have been creating content for thousands of years. Cavemen painted inside caves. The ancient Egyptians created everything from pottery to pyramids. Such creations vary widely, from the magnificent to the simple, across all cultures and ages, but beauty has always been a goal. Philosophers and artists argue that delight is equal to usefulness, and this is even truer for VR.</p>
<p class="indent">VR is a relatively new medium and is not yet well understand. Most other disciplines have been around much longer than VR and although many aspects of other crafts are very different from VR, there are still many elements of those disciplines that we can learn from. For content creation, studying fields such as architecture, urban planning, cinema, music, art, set design, games, literature, and the sciences can add great benefit to VR creations. The chapters within Part <a href="part04.html#part4"><span class="blue">IV</span></a> utilize some concepts from these disciplines that are especially pertinent to VR. Different pieces from different disciplines all must come together in VR to form the experience&#8212;the story, the action and reaction, the characters and social community, the music and art. Integrating these different pieces together, along with some creativity, can result in experiences that are more than the sum of the individual pieces.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Part <a href="part04.html#part4"><span class="blue">IV</span></a></strong> consists of five chapters that focus on creating the assets of virtual worlds.</p>
<p class="hangt"><a id="page_224"></a><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter20.html#ch20"><span class="blue">20</span></a>, High-Level Concepts of Content Creation,</strong> discusses core concepts of content creation common to the most engaging VR experiences: the story, the core experience, conceptual integrity, and gestalt principles.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter21.html#ch21"><span class="blue">21</span></a>, Environmental Design,</strong> discusses design of the environment ranging from different types of geometry to non-visual cues. Designing the environment is more than about just creating pleasing stimuli&#8212;the design of the environment provides clues to affordances, constrains interaction, and enhances wayfinding.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter22.html#ch22"><span class="blue">22</span></a>, Affecting Behavior,</strong> discusses how content creation can affect the states and actions of users. Influencing behavior is especially important for VR because the experience cannot be directly controlled by the system like many other mediums often do. The chapter includes sections on personal wayfinding aids, directing attention, how hardware choice relates to content creation and behavior, and social aspects of VR.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter23.html#ch23"><span class="blue">23</span></a>, Transitioning to VR Content Creation,</strong> discusses how creating for VR is different than creating for other mediums. Ideally, the VR content should be designed from the beginning for VR. However, when that is not possible, several tips are provided to help port existing content to VR.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter24.html#ch24"><span class="blue">24</span></a>, Content Creation: Design Guidelines,</strong> summarizes the previous four chapters and lists a number of actionable guidelines for those creating VR content.</p>
