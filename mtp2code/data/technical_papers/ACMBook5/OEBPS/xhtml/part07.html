<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>THE FUTURE STARTS NOW</strong></h2>
<p class="chblock"><em>The ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world are the ones who do</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Steve Jobs</p>
<p class="noindent">This book has focused on providing a high-level overview of VR and dived into detail on some of the most important concepts. Even for those who have read the book in its entirety, it is only a starting point. There is much more detailed information in the provided references, and even those references are a small proportion of VR research that has occurred over the years. Then there is the general study of neuroscience, human physiology, human-computer interaction, human performance, human factors, etc. The list goes on. However, this in no way means that everything is understood. The field of VR and its many applications is completely wide open. We are in no danger of running out of new possibilities. And hopefully we never run out of those possibilities.</p>
<p class="indent">In the words of one of my former professors, Henry Fuchs, from his IEEE Virtual Reality keynote address, &#8220;We now have the opportunity to change the world&#8212;let&#8217;s not blow it!&#8221; (Fuchs, 2014). The future is here now and it is accessible by anyone, so don&#8217;t be left behind. It is up to you to use VR technology in whatever way you wish in order to help shape the future.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_472"></a><strong>Part <a href="part07.html#part7"><span class="blue">VII</span></a></strong> consists of two chapters that look into the future and provide some basic steps for how to get started in actually creating VR applications.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter35.html#ch35"><span class="blue">35</span></a>, The Present and Future State of VR,</strong> discusses where VR currently stands and where it may lead. Topics include the culture of VR, new generative languages, new indirect and direct ways of interacting, standards and open source, emerging hardware, and the convergence of AR with VR.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter36.html#ch36"><span class="blue">36</span></a>, Getting Started,</strong> is a short chapter explaining how to get started building VR applications. A schedule of tasks is provided that shows how anyone, even those with limited time, can quickly create new virtual worlds.</p>
