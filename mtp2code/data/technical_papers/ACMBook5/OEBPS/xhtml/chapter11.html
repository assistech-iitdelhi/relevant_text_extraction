<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Perception: Design Guidelines</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Objective reality is not always how we perceive it to be and the mind does not always work in ways that we intuitively assume it works. For creating VR experiences, it is more important to understand how we perceive than it is for creating with any other medium. Studying human perception will help VR creators to optimize experiences, invent innovative techniques that are pleasant for humans, and troubleshoot perceptual problems as they arise.</p>
<p class="indent">General guidelines for applying concepts of human perception to creating VR experiences are organized below by chapter.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev11.1"></a><span class="font">11.1</span> Objective and Subjective Reality (Chapter <a href="chapter06.html#ch6"><span class="blue">6</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Study perceptual illusions (Section <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2"><span class="blue">6.2</span></a>) to better understand human perception, identify and test assumptions, interpret experimental results, better design VR worlds, and help understand/solve problems as they come up.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make sensory cues consistent in space and time across sensory modalities so that unintended illusions stranger than real-world illusions do not occur (Sections <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2.4"><span class="blue">6.2.4</span></a> and <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.2.1"><span class="blue">7.2.1</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev11.2"></a><span class="font">11.2</span> Perceptual Models and Processes (Chapter <a href="chapter07.html#ch7"><span class="blue">7</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not discount visceral (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.7.1"><span class="blue">7.7.1</span></a>) and emotional (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.7.4"><span class="blue">7.7.4</span></a>) processes. Use aesthetic intuition to drive initial attraction and positive emotions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use both positive and negative feedback to minimize user frustration and to modify user behavior (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.7.2"><span class="blue">7.7.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make sure users end a VR experience on an emotional high&#8212;the end of the experience is what they are more likely to remember (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.7.4"><span class="blue">7.7.4</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; <a id="page_156"></a>Encourage users to reflect (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.7.3"><span class="blue">7.7.3</span></a>) upon previous positive experiences by providing suggestive cues. For example, provide a review of the highlights of a user&#8217;s performance at the end of the VR experience through a third-person view.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make interfaces intuitive by enabling complexity to be understood with the simplest mental model possible that can achieve the desired result, but not simpler (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a>). This will help to minimize learned helplessness.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use signifying cues, feedback, and constraints to help the user form quality mental models and to make assumptions explicit (Sections <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a> and <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.1"><span class="blue">25.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not fall into the trap of focusing only on one&#8217;s own preferred sensory modality. Provide sensory cues across all modalities to cover a wider range of users (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.2"><span class="blue">7.9.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use consistency as users will form filters that generalize perception of events and interactions (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.3"><span class="blue">7.9.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide cues to bring back memories in order to associate the experience with a previous real-life or virtual event (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.3"><span class="blue">7.9.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be aware that users make decisions early in a VR experience and they are more likely to stick with those decisions rather than change them (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.3"><span class="blue">7.9.3</span></a>). Make it easy for users to decide that they like an experience from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Define personas (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.10"><span class="blue">31.10</span></a>) so that the VR experience can be designed to take advantage of the target audience&#8217;s filters of general values, beliefs, attitudes, and memories (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.3"><span class="blue">7.9.3</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev11.3"></a><span class="font">11.3</span> Perceptual Modalities (Chapter <a href="chapter08.html#ch8"><span class="blue">8</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; VR creators should be very cognizant of what colors they choose as arbitrary colors can result in unintended consequences (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.1.3"><span class="blue">8.1.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use binaural cues with head pose to give a sense of sound location (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.2.2"><span class="blue">8.2.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use audio when precise timing (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.2"><span class="blue">8.2</span></a>) is important and use visuals when precise location is important (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.1.4"><span class="blue">8.1.4</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev11.4"></a><span class="font">11.4</span> Perception of Space and Time (Chapter <a href="chapter09.html#ch9"><span class="blue">9</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Think in terms of personal space, action space, and vista space when designing environments and interactions (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.2"><span class="blue">9.1.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider how the relative importance of depth cues varies as a function of distance. Some depth cues are more relevant at different distances (Table <span class="blue">9.2</span>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_157"></a>&#8226; Use a variety of depth cues to improve spatial judgments and enhance presence (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use text located in space instead of 2D heads-up displays so the text has a distance from the user and occlusion is handled properly (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not place essential stimuli that must be consistently viewed close to the eye (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not forget that depth is not only a function of presented visual stimuli. Users perceive depth differently depending on their intentions and fear (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be careful of having two visuals or sounds occur too closely in time as masking can cause the second stimulus to perceptually erase the earlier stimulus (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.2.2"><span class="blue">9.2.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be careful of sequence and timing of events. Changing the order can completely change the meaning (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.2.1"><span class="blue">9.2.1</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev11.5"></a><span class="font">11.5</span> Perceptual Stability, Attention, and Action (Chapter <a href="chapter10.html#ch10"><span class="blue">10</span></a>)</h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Include a sufficient number of distance cues and keep them consistent with each other so that size constancy, shape constancy, and position constancy are maintained (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.1"><span class="blue">10.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider using primarily red colors and lighting for dark scenes to maintain dark adaptation while maintaining high visual acuity for foveal vision (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2.1"><span class="blue">10.2.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Don&#8217;t expect users to notice or remember events just because they are within their field of view (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.1"><span class="blue">10.3.1</span></a>). Use salience (e.g., a shiny/colorful object or a spatialized sound) to capture a person&#8217;s attention (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider getting a user&#8217;s attention first through spatialized audio to prepare them in advance for an event (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Attention can also be captured by objects that seem out of place and by putting objects where they expect them (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To increase performance, remove task-irrelevant stimuli (especially highly salient stimuli and when the task is easy). To make a task more challenging, consider adding distracting stimuli (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Collect data to build attention maps to determine what actually attracts users&#8217; attention (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To optimize searching, emphasize feature searching by making the searched-for objects distinct from surrounding stimuli (e.g., objects having angled lines <a id="page_158"></a>where surrounding features don&#8217;t include angled lines) so the searched-for items seem to &#8220;pop out&#8221; from a surrounding blur of irrelevant features (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To make a search task more challenging, emphasize conjunction searching by making the searched-for objects have particular combinations of features and including many similar objects (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To maximize flow, match difficulty with the individual&#8217;s skill level (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.3.2"><span class="blue">10.3.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Have computer-controlled characters perform interactions to help users learn the same interactions (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.4.2"><span class="blue">10.4.2</span></a>).</p>
