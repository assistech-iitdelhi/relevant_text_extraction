<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>PERCEPTION</strong></h2>
<p class="chblock"><em>We see things not as they are, but as we are&#8212;that is, we see the world not as it is, but as molded by the individual peculiarities of our minds</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;G. T. W. Patrick (<a href="reference.html#ref235"><span class="blue">1890</span></a>)</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg55lev1"></a>Of all the technologies required for a VR system to be successful, there is one component that is most essential. Fortunately, it is widely available, although most of the population is only vaguely aware of it, fewer have even a moderate understanding of how it operates, and no single individual completely understands it. Like most technologies, it originally started in a very simple form, but has since evolved into a much more sophisticated and intelligent platform. In fact, it is the single most complicated system in existence today, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. It is the human brain.</p>
<p class="indent">The human brain contains approximately 100 billion neurons and, on average, each of these neurons is connected by thousands of synapses&#8212;structures that allow neurons to pass an electrochemical signal to another cell&#8212;resulting in hundreds of trillions of synaptic connections that can simultaneously exchange and process prodigious amounts of information over a massively parallel neural network in milliseconds (Marois and Ivanoff, 2005). In fact, every cubic millimeter of cerebral cortex contains roughly a billion synapses (Alonso-Nanclares et al., 2008). The white matter of the nervous system contains approximately 150,000&#8211;180,000 km of myelinated nerve fibers at age 20 (i.e., the connecting wires in our white matter could circle the earth ~4 times), connecting all these neuronal elements. Despite the monumental number of components in the brain, it is estimated that each neuron is able to contact any other <a id="page_56"></a>neuron with no more than six interneuronal connections or &#8220;six degrees of separation&#8221; (Drachman, 2005).</p>
<p class="indent">Many of us tend to believe that we understand human behavior and the human mind&#8212;after all we are human and should therefore understand ourselves. To some extent this is true&#8212;knowing the basics is enough to function in the real world or to experience VR. In fact, this part can be skipped if the intent is to simply re-create what others have already built or to even create new simple worlds (although a theoretical background does help to fine-tune one&#8217;s creations). However, most of what we perceive and do is a result of subconscious processes. To go beyond the basics of VR to create the most innovative experiences in a way that is comfortable and intuitive to work with, a more detailed understanding of perception is helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">What is meant by &#8220;beyond the basics of VR&#8221;? VR is a relatively new medium and the vast space of artificial realities that could be created is largely unexplored. Thus, we get to make it all up. In fact, many believe providing direct access to digital media through VR has no limits. Whereas that may be true, that does not mean every possible arrangement of input and output will result in a quality VR experience. In fact, only a fraction of the possible input/output combinations will result in a comprehensible and satisfying experience. Understanding how we perceive reality is essential to designing truly innovative VR applications that effectively present and react to users. Some concepts discussed in this part directly apply to VR today and other concepts may apply in ways we can&#8217;t yet fathom. Understanding the core concepts of human perception might just enable us to recognize new opportunities as VR improves and the vast array of new VR experiences is explored.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course studying perception is valuable in designing any product; e.g., desktop or hand-held applications. For VR, it is essential. Rarely has someone become sick due to a bad traditional software design (although plenty of us have become frustrated!), but sickness is common for a bad VR design. VR designers integrate more senses into a single experience, and if sensations are not consistent, then users can become physically ill (multiple chapters are devoted to this&#8212;see Part <a href="part03.html#part3"><span class="blue">III</span></a>). Thus, understanding the human half of the hybrid interaction design is more important for VR applications than it is for traditional applications. Once we have obtained this knowledge, then we can more intelligently experiment with the rules. Simply put, the better our understanding of human perception, the better we can create and iterate upon quality VR experiences.</p>
<p class="indent">The material in this part will help readers become more aware and appreciative of the real world, and how we humans perceive it. It addresses less common questions such as the following.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Why do the images on my eyeballs not seem to move when I rotate my eyes? See Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.4"><span class="blue">7.4</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_57"></a>&#8226; What is the resolution of the human eye? See Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.1.4"><span class="blue">8.1.4</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Why does a character not seem to change sizes when that character walks away from the camera in a movie or game even though his image takes up a smaller portion of the screen? See Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.1"><span class="blue">10.1</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indentt">By asking and understanding the answers to these types of questions (albeit we are far from knowing all the answers!), we can create better VR experiences in more innovative ways.</p>
<p class="indent">To appreciate perception, consider what you are experiencing at this very moment. You are reading the pages of this book without consciously thinking about how these abstract symbols called letters and words convey meaning in your mind. The same holds true for pictures. <strong>Trompe-l&#8217;&#339;il</strong> (French for &#8220;deceive the eye&#8221;) is an art technique that uses realistic 2D imagery to create the illusion of 3D. Looking at the trompe-l&#8217;&#339;il lobby art in Figure <a href="part02.html#figII.1">II.1</a>, you may perceive a lobby floor that opens up to lower levels of the building. In reality, you are seeing multiple 2D planes giving the illusion of depth (the real 3D world containing this 2D page or display showing a 2D photograph of a 3D scene containing a planar lobby surface with 2D art). Unfortunately, trompe-l&#8217;&#339;il art only provides an illusion of 3D from a specific static viewing location. Move a few centimeters and the illusion breaks down. VR uses head tracking so illusions work from any viewpoint, in some cases even as one physically walks around.</p>
<p class="indent">Subconscious perception goes beyond vision. For example, perhaps you are touching this book or a table and do not consciously consider that specific feeling of touch until this prose suggested it. Conversely, even though you may not have been aware of that touch before the previous statement, you probably would have noticed if you did not feel anything. This lack of touch in most VR applications is a major difference between the real world and virtual worlds, and is one of the significant challenges of VR (see Section <a href="chapter26.html#lev26.8"><span class="blue">26.8</span></a>). Nevertheless, innovative, well-funded companies are taking on the challenge to circumvent or otherwise solve the current lack of perfect feedback mechanisms for VR. Whereas there are undoubtedly challenges, the arena is rapidly evolving, and such problems represent opportunities rather than barriers for the proliferation of VR.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Part <a href="part02.html#part2"><span class="blue">II</span></a></strong> consists of several chapters that focus on different aspects of human perception.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter06.html#ch6"><span class="blue">6</span></a>, Objective and Subjective Reality,</strong> discusses the differences between what actually exists in the world and how we perceive what exists. The two can often be very different as demonstrated by various perceptual illusions described in the chapter.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure II.1</span> Trompe-l&#8217;&#339;il lobby art.</strong></p>
<p class="hang"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter07.html#ch7"><span class="blue">7</span></a>, Perceptual Models and Processes,</strong> discusses different models and ways of thinking about how the human mind works. Because the brain is so complex, no single model explains everything and it is useful to think about how physiological processes and perception work from different perspectives.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter08.html#ch8"><span class="blue">8</span></a>, Perceptual Modalities,</strong> discusses our sensory receptors and how signals from those receptors are transformed into sight, hearing, touch, proprioception, balance and physical motion, smell, and taste.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter09.html#ch9"><span class="blue">9</span></a>, Perception of Space and Time,</strong> discusses how we perceive the layout of the world around us, how we perceive time, and how we perceive the motion of both objects and ourselves.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter10.html#ch10"><span class="blue">10</span></a>, Perceptual Stability, Attention, and Action,</strong> discusses how we perceive the world to be consistent even when signals reaching our sensory receptors change, how we focus on items of interest while excluding others, and how perception relates to taking action.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter11.html#ch11"><span class="blue">11</span></a>, Perception: Practitioner&#8217;s Summary and Design Guidelines,</strong> summarizes Part <a href="part02.html#part2"><span class="blue">II</span></a> and provides perception guidelines for VR creators.</p>
