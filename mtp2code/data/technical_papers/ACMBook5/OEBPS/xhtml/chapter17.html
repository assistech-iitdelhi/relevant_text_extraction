<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Summary of Factors That Contribute to Adverse Effects</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Adverse health effects due to sensory incongruences do not only occur from VR. About 90% of the population have experienced some form of travel sickness and about 1% of the population get sick from riding in automobiles. [<a href="reference.html#ref177"><span class="blue">Lawson 2014</span></a>]. About 70% <a id="pg197lev1"></a>of naval personnel experience seasickness, with the greater problems occurring on smaller ships and rougher seas. Up to 5% of those traveling by sea fail to adapt through the duration of the voyage, and some may show effects weeks after the end of the voyage (this is known as land sickness), resulting in postural instability and perceived instability of the visual field during self-movement. VR systems of the 1990s resulted in as many as 80%&#8211;95% of users reporting sickness symptoms, and 5%&#8211;30% had symptoms severe enough to discontinue exposure [<a href="reference.html#ref113"><span class="blue">Harm 2002</span></a>]. Fortunately, extreme cases of vomiting from VR is not as bad as real-world motion sickness&#8212;75% of those suffering from seasickness vomit whereas vomiting in simulators is rare at 1% [<a href="reference.html#ref157"><span class="blue">Kennedy et al. 1993</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter summarizes contributing factors to adverse health effects, several of which have been previously discussed. It is extremely important to understand these in order to create the most comfortable experiences and to minimize sickness. Contributing factors and interaction between these factors can be complex&#8212;some may not affect users until combined with other problems (e.g., fast head motion may not be a problem until latency exceeds some value). The contributing factors are divided into groups of system factors, individual user factors, and application design factors. Each group of factors is an important contributor to VR sickness, as without one of them there would be no adverse effects (e.g., turn off the system, provide no content, or remove the user), but then there would be no VR experience. These lists were created from a number of publications, the author&#8217;s personal experience, discussions <a id="page_198"></a>with others, and editing/additions from John Baker (personal communication, May 27, 2015) of Chosen Realities LLC and former chief engineer of the army&#8217;s Dismounted Soldier Training System, a VR/HMD system that trained over 65,000 soldiers with over a million man-hours of use.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev17.1"></a><span class="font">17.1</span> System Factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">System factors of VR sickness are technical shortcomings that technology will eventually solve through engineering efforts. Even small optical misalignment and distortions may cause sickness. Factors are listed in approximate order of decreasing importance.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Latency.</strong>&#160;&#160;Latency in most VR systems causes more error than all other errors combined [<a href="reference.html#ref125"><span class="blue">Holloway 1997</span></a>] and is often the greatest cause of VR sickness. Because of this, latency is discussed in extensive detail in Chapter <a href="chapter15.html#ch15"><span class="blue">15</span></a>.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Calibration.</strong>&#160;&#160;Lack of precise calibration can be a major cause of VR sickness. The worst effect of bad calibration is inappropriate scene motion/scene instability that occurs when the user moves her head. Important calibration includes accurate <a id="pg198lev1"></a>tracker offsets (the world-to-tracker offset, tracker-to-sensor offset, sensor-to-display offset, display-to-eye offset), mismatched field-of-view parameters, misalignment of optics, incorrect distortion parameters, etc. <a href="reference.html#ref126"><span class="blue">Holloway</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref126"><span class="blue">1995</span></a>] discusses error due to miscalibration in detail.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Tracking accuracy.</strong>&#160;&#160;Low-accuracy head trackers result in seeing the world from an incorrect viewpoint. Inertial sensors used in phones result in yaw drift over time, causing heading to become less accurate over time. A magnetometer can sense the earth&#8217;s magnetic field to reduce drift, but rebar in floors, I-beams in tall buildings, computers/monitors, etc. can cause distortion to vary as the user changes position. Error in tracking the hands does not cause motion sickness, although such error can cause usability problems.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Tracking precision.</strong>&#160;&#160;Low precision results in <strong>jitter</strong>, which for head tracking is perceived as shaking of the world. Precision/jitter can be reduced via filtering at the cost of latency.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Lack of position tracking.</strong>&#160;&#160;VR systems that only track orientation (i.e., not position) result in the virtual world moving with the user when the user translates. For example, as the user leans down to pick something off the floor, the floor extends downward. Users can learn to minimize changing position, but even subtle changes in position can contribute to VR sickness. If no position tracking is <a id="page_199"></a>available, calibrate the sensor-to-eye offset to estimate motion parallax as the user rotates her head.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Field of view.</strong>&#160;&#160;Displays with wide field of view result in more motion sickness due to (1) users being more sensitive to vection in the periphery, (2) the scene moving over a larger portion of the eyes, and (3) scene motion (either unintentional due to other shortcomings or intentional by design&#8212;e.g., when navigating through a world). A perfect wide field-of-view VR system with no scene motion would not cause motion sickness.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Refresh rate.</strong>&#160;&#160;High display refresh rates can reduce latency, judder, and flicker. Ideally refresh rates should be as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Judder.</strong>&#160;&#160;Judder is the appearance of jerky or unsmooth visual motion and is discussed in Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.6"><span class="blue">9.3.6</span></a>.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Display response time and persistence.</strong>&#160;&#160;Display response time is the time it takes for a pixel to reach some percentage of its intended intensity (Section <a href="chapter15.html#lev15.4.4"><span class="blue">15.4.4</span></a>). Persistence is the time that pixels remain on the display after reaching their intended intensity. Such timings have trade-offs of judder, motion smear/blur, <a id="pg199lev1"></a>flicker, and latency&#8212;all of which are a problem, so these should all be considered when choosing hardware.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Flicker.</strong>&#160;&#160;Flicker (Sections <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.2.4"><span class="blue">9.2.4</span></a> and <a href="chapter13.html#lev13.3"><span class="blue">13.3</span></a>) is distracting, induces eye fatigue, and can cause seizures. As luminance increases, more flicker is perceived. Flicker is also more perceivable with wider-field-of-view HMDs. Displays that have longer response times and longer persistence (e.g., LCDs) can reduce flicker at the cost of adding motion blur, latency, and/or judder.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Vergence/accommodation conflict.</strong>&#160;&#160;For conventional HMDs, accommodative distance remains constant whereas vergence does not (Section <a href="chapter13.html#lev13.1"><span class="blue">13.1</span></a>). Visuals should not be placed close to the eye, and if they are then only for short periods of time to reduce strain on the eyes.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Binocular images.</strong>&#160;&#160;HMDs can present monocular (one image for a single eye), biocular (identical images for each eye), or binocular images (two different images for each eye that provide a sense of depth) (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>). Incorrect binocular images can result in double images and eye strain.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Eye separation.</strong>&#160;&#160;For many VR systems, the inter-image distance, inter-lens distance, and interpupillary distance are often in conflict with each other. This conflict can give rise to visual discomfort symptoms and muscle imbalances in users&#8217; eyes [<a href="reference.html#ref50"><span class="blue">Costello 1997</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_200"></a><strong>Real-world peripheral vision.</strong>&#160;&#160;HMDs that are open in the peripherey where users can see the real world reduce vection due to the real world acting as a stable rest frame (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.4"><span class="blue">12.3.4</span></a>). Theoretically, this factor would not make a difference for an HMD that is perfectly calibrated.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Headset fit.</strong>&#160;&#160;Improperly fitting HMDs (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.2"><span class="blue">14.2</span></a>) can cause discomfort and pressure, which can lead to headaches. For those who wear eyeglasses, HMDs that push up against the glasses can be very uncomfortable or even painful. Improper fit also results in larger HMD slippage and corresponding scene motion.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Weight and center of mass.</strong>&#160;&#160;A heavy HMD or HMD with an offset center of mass (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.1"><span class="blue">14.1</span></a>) can tire the neck, which can lead to headaches and also modify the way distance and self-motion are perceived.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Motion platforms.</strong>&#160;&#160;Motion platforms can significantly reduce motion sickness if implemented well (Section <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.8"><span class="blue">18.8</span></a>). However, if implemented badly then motion sickness can increase due to adding physical motion cues that are not congruent with visual cues.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Hygiene.</strong>&#160;&#160;Hygiene (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.4"><span class="blue">14.4</span></a>) is especially important for public use. Bad smells are a problem as nobody wants a stinky HMD and bad smells can cause nausea.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="pg200lev1"></a><strong>Temperature.</strong>&#160;&#160;Reports of discomfort go up as temperature increases beyond room temperature [<a href="reference.html#ref237"><span class="blue">Pausch et al. 1996</span></a>]. Isolated heat near the eyes can occur due to lack of ventilation.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Dirty screens.</strong>&#160;&#160;Dirty screens can cause eye strain due to not being able to see clearly.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev17.2"></a><span class="font">17.2</span> Individual User Factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">Susceptibility to VR sickness is polygenic (a function of multiple genes, although specific genes contributing to sickness are not yet known), and perhaps the greatest factor for VR sickness is the individual. In fact, <a href="reference.html#ref170"><span class="blue">Lackner</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref170"><span class="blue">2014</span></a>] claims the range of vulnerability varies by a factor of 10,000 to 1. Some people immediately exhibit all the signs of VR sickness within moments of using a VR system, others exhibit only a few signs after some period of use, and some exhibit no signs of sickness after extended use for all but the most extreme conditions. Almost anyone exposed to provocative physical body motion or who is exposed to dramatic inconsistencies between the vestibular and visual systems can to some extent be made sick. The only exception is those who have a total loss of vestibular function [<a href="reference.html#ref177"><span class="blue">Lawson 2014</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">Not only is there variability to susceptibility of VR sickness between individuals, but individuals are affected differently by different causes. For example, lateral (e.g., <a id="page_201"></a>strafing) motions make some users uncomfortable [<a href="reference.html#ref232"><span class="blue"><em>Oculus Best Practices</em> 2015</span></a>] where other users have no problem whatsoever with such motions, even though they are susceptible to other provocative motions. Other users seem more susceptible to problems caused by accommodation-vergence conflict&#8212;perhaps this is related to the decreased ability to focus with age. Furthermore, new users are almost always more susceptible to motion sickness than more experienced users. Because of these differences, different users often have very different opinions of what is important for reducing sickness. One way to deal with this is by providing configuration options so that users can choose between different configurations to optimize their comfort. For example, a smaller field of view can be more appropriate for new users.</p>
<p class="indent">Even though there are dramatic differences between individuals, three key factors seem to affect how much individuals get sick [<a href="reference.html#ref170"><span class="blue">Lackner 2014</span></a>]:</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; sensitivity to provocative motion,</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; the rate of adaptation, and</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; the decay time of elicited symptoms.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="pg201lev1"></a>These three key factors may explain why some individuals are better able to adapt to VR over a period of time. For example, a person with high sensitivity but with a high rate of adaptation and short decay time can eventually experience less sickness than an individual with moderate sensitivity but a low rate of adaptability and long decay time.</p>
<p class="indent">Listed below are descriptions of more specific individual factors that correlate to VR sickness in approximate order of decreasing importance.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Prior history of motion sickness.</strong> In the behavioral sciences, past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Evidence suggests it is also the case that an individual&#8217;s history of motion sickness (physically induced or visually induced) predicts VR sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Health.</strong> Those not in their usual state of health and fitness should not use VR as unhealthiness can contribute to VR sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>]. Symptoms that make individuals more susceptible include hangover, flu, respiratory illness, head cold, ear infection, ear blockage, upset stomach, emotional stress, fatigue, dehydration, and sleep deprivation. Those under the influence of drugs (legal or illegal) or alcohol should not use VR.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>VR experience.</strong> Due to adaptation, increased experience with VR generally leads to decreased incidence of VR sickness.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong><a id="page_202"></a>Thinking about sickness.</strong> Users who think about getting sick are more likely to get sick. Suggesting to users that they may experience sickness can cause them to dwell on adverse effects, making the situation worse than if they were not informed [<a href="reference.html#ref342"><span class="blue">Young et al. 2007</span></a>]. This causes an ethical dilemma as not warning users can be a problem as well (e.g., users should be aware of sickness so they can make an informed decision and know to stop the experience if they start to feel ill). Users should be casually warned that people experience some &#8220;discomfort&#8221; and not to try to &#8220;tough it out&#8221; if they start to experience any adverse effects, but do not overemphasize sickness so they are less likely to become overly concerned.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Gender.</strong> Females are as much as three times more susceptible to VR sickness than males [<a href="reference.html#ref295"><span class="blue">Stanney et al. 2014</span></a>]. Possible explanations include hormonal differences, field-of-view differences (females have a larger field of view which is associated with greater VR sickness), and biased self-report data (males may tend to under-report symptoms).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Age.</strong> Susceptibility to physically induced motion sickness is greatest at ages 2&#8211;12 (kids are the ones who get sick in a car), decreases rapidly from ages 12&#8211;21, and <a id="pg202lev1"></a>then decreases more slowly thereafter [<a href="reference.html#ref258"><span class="blue">Reason and Brand 1975</span></a>]. VR sickness, however, increases with age [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks et al. 2010</span></a>]. The reason for the difference of age effects on physically induced motion sickness vs. VR sickness is not clear, but it could be due to confounding factors such as experience (flight hours for flight simulators and video game experience for immersive entertainment), excitement, lack of the ability to accommodate, concentration level, balance capability, etc.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Mental model/expectations.</strong> Users are more likely to get sick if scene motion does not match their expectations (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.4.7"><span class="blue">12.4.7</span></a>). For example, gamers accustomed to first-person shooter games may have different expectations than what occurs with commonly used VR navigation methods. Most first-person shooter games have the view direction, weapon/arm, and forward direction always pointing in the same direction. Because of this, gamers often expect their bodies to go wherever their head is pointing, even if walking on a treadmill. When navigation direction does not match viewing/head direction, their mental model can break down and confusion along with sickness can result (sometimes called <strong>Call of Duty Syndrome</strong>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Interpupillary distance.</strong> The distance between the eyes of most adults ranges from 45 to 80 mm and goes as low as 40 mm for children down to five years <a id="page_203"></a>of age [<a href="reference.html#ref74"><span class="blue">Dodgson 2004</span></a>]. VR systems should be calibrated for each individual&#8217;s interpupillary distance. Otherwise, eye strain, headaches, general discomfort, and associated problems can result.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Not knowing what looks correct.</strong> Simply telling someone to put an HMD on doesn&#8217;t mean that it is properly secured on the head and in the correct position. The user&#8217;s eyes may not be in the sweet spots, the headset can be at an odd angle, the headset can be loose, etc. Educating users how to put on the headset and asking the user to look at objects and stating &#8220;adjust the headset until comfortable and the objects in the display are crisp and clear&#8221; can help reduce negative effects.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Sense of balance.</strong> Postural instability (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.3"><span class="blue">12.3.3</span></a>) correlates well with motion sickness. Pre-VR postural stability is most strongly associated with the nausea and disorientation subscale of the Kennedy SSQ [<a href="reference.html#ref164"><span class="blue">Kolasinski 1995</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Flicker-fusion frequency threshold.</strong> A person&#8217;s flicker-fusion frequency threshold is the flicker frequency where flicker becomes visually perceptible (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.2.4"><span class="blue">9.2.4</span></a>). There is a wide individual variability in flicker-fusion threshold across individuals due to time of day, gender, age, and intelligence [<a href="reference.html#ref164"><span class="blue">Kolasinski 1995</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="pg203lev1"></a><strong>Real-world task experience.</strong> More experienced pilots (i.e., those who have more real flight hours) are more susceptible to simulator sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>]. This is likely due to having higher sensitivity to expectations of how the real world should behave for the task being simulated.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Migraine history.</strong> Individuals with a history of migraines have a tendency to experience higher levels of VR sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref229"><span class="blue">Nichols et al. 2000</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indentt">There are likely several other individual user factors that contribute to VR sickness. For example, it has been hypothesized that ethnicity, concentration, mental rotation ability, and field independence may correlate with susceptibility to VR sickness [<a href="reference.html#ref164"><span class="blue">Kolasinski 1995</span></a>]. However, there has been little conclusive research so far to support these claims.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev17.3"></a><strong><span class="blue"><span class="font">17.3</span></span> Application Design Factors</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even if all technical issues were perfectly solved (e.g., zero latency, perfect calibration, and unlimited computing resources), content can still cause VR sickness. This is due to the human physiological hardware of our bodies and brains instead of the technical limitations of human-made hardware. Note users can drive content via head motions <a id="page_204"></a>and navigation techniques so those actions are included here. Factors are listed in approximate order of decreasing importance.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Frame rate.</strong> A slow frame rate contributes to latency (Section <a href="chapter15.html#lev15.4.3"><span class="blue">15.4.3</span></a>). Frame rate is listed here as an application factor vs. a system factor as frame rate depends on the application&#8217;s scene complexity and software optimizations. A consistent frame rate is also important. A frame rate that jumps back and forth between 30 Hz and 60 Hz can be worse than a consistent frame rate of 30 Hz.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Locus of control.</strong> Actively being in control of one&#8217;s navigation reduces motion sickness (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.4.6"><span class="blue">12.4.6</span></a>). Motion sickness is often less for pilots and drivers than for passive co-pilots and passengers [<a href="reference.html#ref164"><span class="blue">Kolasinski 1995</span></a>]. Control allows one to anticipate future motions.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Visual acceleration.</strong> Virtually accelerating one&#8217;s viewpoint can result in motion sickness (Sections <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.2"><span class="blue">12.2</span></a> and <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.5"><span class="blue">18.5</span></a>), so the use of visual accelerations should be minimized (e.g., head bobbing that simulates walking causes oscillating visual accelerations and should never be used). If visual accelerations must be used, the period of acceleration should be as short as possible.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="pg204lev1"></a><strong>Physical head motion.</strong> For imperfect systems (e.g., a system with latency or inaccurate calibration), motion sickness is significantly reduced when individuals keep their head still, due to those imperfections only causing scene motion when the head is moved (Section <a href="chapter15.html#lev15.1"><span class="blue">15.1</span></a>). If the system has more than ~30 ms of latency, content should be designed for infrequent and slow head movement. Although head motion could be considered an individual user factor, it is categorized here since content can suggest head motions.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Duration.</strong> VR sickness increases with the duration of the experience [<a href="reference.html#ref164"><span class="blue">Kolasinski 1995</span></a>]. Content should be created for short experiences, allowing for breaks between sessions.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Vection.</strong> Vection is an illusion of self-motion when one is not actually physically moving (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.10"><span class="blue">9.3.10</span></a>). Vection often, but not always, causes motion sickness.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Binocular-occlusion conflict.</strong> Stereoscopic cues that do not match occlusion clues can lead to eye strain and confusion (Section <a href="chapter13.html#lev13.2"><span class="blue">13.2</span></a>). 2D heads-up displays that result from porting from existing games often have this problem (Section <a href="chapter23.html#lev23.2.2"><span class="blue">23.2.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Virtual rotation.</strong> Virtual rotations of one&#8217;s viewpoint can result in motion sickness (Section <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.5"><span class="blue">18.5</span></a>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Gorilla arm.</strong> Arm fatigue can result from extended use of above-the-waist gestural interfaces when there is not frequent opportunity to rest the arms (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.1"><span class="blue">14.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_205"></a><strong>Rest frames.</strong> Humans have a strong bias toward worlds that are stationary. If some visual cues can be presented that are consistent with the vestibular system (even if other visual cues are not), motion sickness can be reduced (Sections <span class="blue">12.3.4</span> and <span class="blue">18.2</span>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Standing/walking vs. sitting.</strong> VR sickness rates are greater for standing users vs. sitting users, which correlates with postural stability [<a href="reference.html#page_559"><span class="blue">Polonen 2010</span></a>]. This is in congruence with the postural instability theory (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.3"><span class="blue">12.3.3</span></a>). Due to being blind and deaf to the real world, there is also more risk of injury due to falling down and collisions with real-world objects/cables when standing. Requiring users to always stand or navigate excessively via some form of walking also results in fatigue (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.1"><span class="blue">14.1</span></a>).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Height above the ground.</strong> Visual flow is directly related to velocity and inversely related to altitude. Low altitude in flight simulators has been found to be one of the strongest contributions to simulator sickness due to more of the visual field containing moving stimuli [<a href="reference.html#ref151"><span class="blue">Johnson 2005</span></a>]. Some users have reported that being placed visually at a different height than their real-world physical height causes them to feel ill.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="pg205lev1"></a><strong>Excessive binocular disparity.</strong> Objects that are too close to the eyes result in seeing a double image due to the eyes not being able to properly fuse the left and right eye images.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>VR entrance and exit.</strong> The display should be blanked or users should shut their eyes when putting on or taking off the HMD. Visual stimuli that are not part of the VR application should not be shown to users (i.e., do not show the operating system desktop when changing applications).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Luminance.</strong> Luminance is related to flicker. Dark conditions may result in less problems for displays with little persistence (e.g., CRTs or OLEDs) and a low refresh rate [<a href="reference.html#ref236"><span class="blue">Pausch et al. 1992</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Repetitive strain.</strong> Repetitive strain injury results from carrying out prolonged repeated activities (Section <a href="chapter14.html#lev14.3"><span class="blue">14.3</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev17.4"></a><strong><span class="font">17.4</span> Presence vs. Motion Sickness</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The rest frame hypothesis (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.4"><span class="blue">12.3.4</span></a>) claims the sense of presence (Section <a href="chapter04.html#lev4.2"><span class="blue">4.2</span></a>) correlates with the stability of rest frames [<a href="reference.html#ref251"><span class="blue">Prothero and Parker 2003</span></a>]. For example, a perfectly calibrated system with the entire scene acting as a rest frame that is truly stable relative to the real world (i.e., no scene motion) can indeed have high presence. <a id="page_206"></a>However, this claim does not hold under all conditions. For example, adding non-realistic real-world stabilized cues to the environment as one flies forward in order to reduce sickness (Section <a href="chapter18.html#lev18.2"><span class="blue">18.2</span></a>) can reduce presence, especially if the rest of the environment is realistic.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors that enhance presence (e.g., wider field of view) can also enhance vection and in many cases vection is a VR design goal. Unfortunately, some of these same presence-enhancing variables can also increase motion sickness. Likewise, design techniques can be used to reduce the sense of self-motion and motion sickness. Such trade-offs should be considered when designing VR experiences.</p>
