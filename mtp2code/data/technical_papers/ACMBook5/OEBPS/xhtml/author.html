<p class="noindent"><strong>Jason Jerald</strong>, PhD, is Co-Founder and Principal Consultant at NextGen Interactions. In addition to primarily focusing on NextGen Interactions and its clients, Jason is Chief Scientist at Digital ArtForms, is Adjunct Visiting Professor at the Waterford Institute of Technology, serves on multiple advisory boards of companies focusing on VR technologies, coordinates the Research Triangle Park VR Meetup, and speaks about VR at various events throughout the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Jason has been creating VR systems and applications for approximately 20 years. He has been involved in over 60 VR-related projects across more than 30 organizations including Valve, Oculus, Virtuix, Sixense, NASA, General Motors, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, three U.S. national laboratories, and five universities. Jason&#8217;s work has been featured on ABC&#8217;s <em>Shark Tank</em>, on the Discovery Channel, on the UK&#8217;s <em>Gadget Show</em>, in the <em>New York Times</em>, and on the cover of the MIT Press journal <em>Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments</em>. He has held various technical and leadership positions including building and leading a team of approximately 300 individuals, and has served on the ACM SIGGRAPH, IEEE Virtual Reality, and IEEE 3D User Interface Committees.</p>
<p class="indent">Jason earned a Bachelor of Computer Science degree with an emphasis in Computer Graphics and Minors in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering from Washington State University. He earned a Masters and a Doctorate in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a focus on perception of motion and latency in VR. His graduate work consisted of building a VR system with under 8 ms of end-to-end latency; the development of a mathematical model relating latency, head motion, scene motion, and perceptual thresholds; and validation of the model through psychophysics experiments. Jason as authored over 20 publications and patents directly related to VR.</p>
