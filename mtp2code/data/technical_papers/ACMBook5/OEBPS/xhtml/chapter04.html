<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Immersion, Presence, and Reality Trade-Offs</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">VR is about psychologically being in a place different than where one is physically located, where that place may be a replica of the real world or may be an imaginary world that does not exist and never could exist. Either way there are some commonalities and essential concepts that must be understood to have users feel like they are somewhere else. This chapter discusses immersion, presence, and trade-offs of reality.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev4.1"></a><a id="pg45lev1"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">4.1</span></span> Immersion</h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Immersion</strong> is the objective degree to which a VR system and application projects stimuli onto the sensory receptors of users in a way that is extensive, matching, surrounding, vivid, interactive, and plot informing [<a href="reference.html#ref290"><span class="blue">Slater and Wilbur 1997</span></a>].</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Extensiveness</strong> is the range of sensory modalities presented to the user (e.g., visuals, audio, and physical force).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Matching</strong> is the congruence between sensory modalities (e.g., appropriate visual presentation corresponding to head motion and a virtual representation of one&#8217;s own body).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Surroundness</strong> is the extent to which cues are panoramic (e.g., wide field of view, spatialized audio, 360&#176; tracking).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Vividness</strong> is the quality of energy simulated (e.g., resolution, lighting, frame rate, audio bitrate).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Interactability</strong> is the capability for the user to make changes to the world, the response of virtual entities to the user&#8217;s actions, and the user&#8217;s ability to influence future events.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Plot</strong> is the story&#8212;the consistent portrayal of a message or experience, the dynamic unfolding sequence of events, and the behavior of the world and its entities.</p>
<p class="indentt"><a id="page_46"></a>Immersion is the objective technology that has the potential to engage users in the experience. However, immersion is only part of the VR experience as it takes a human to perceive and interpret the presented stimuli. Immersion can lead the mind but cannot control the mind. How the user subjectively experiences the immersion is known as presence.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev4.2"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">4.2</span></span> Presence</h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Presence,</strong> in short, is a sense of &#8220;being there&#8221; inside a space, even when physically located in a different location. Because presence is an internal psychological state and a form of visceral communication (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2.1"><span class="blue">1.2.1</span></a>), it is difficult to describe in words&#8212;it is something that can only be understood when experienced. Attempting to describe presence is like attempting to describe concepts such as consciousness or the feeling of love, and can be just as controversial. Nonetheless, the VR community craves a definition of presence, as such a definition would be useful for designing VR experiences. The definition of presence is based on a discussion that took place via the presence-l listserv during the spring of 2000 among members of a community of scholars interested in the presence concept. The lengthy explication, available on the ISPR website (<span class="weblink"><a href="http://ispr.info"><span class="blue">http://ispr.info</span></a></span>), begins with</p>
<p class="blockquotet">Presence is a psychological state or subjective perception in which even though part or all of an individual&#8217;s current experience is generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, part or all of the individual&#8217;s perception fails to accurately acknowledge the role of the technology in the experience. (International Society for Presence Research, 2000)</p>
<p class="indentt">Whereas immersion is about the characteristics of technology, presence is an internal psychological and physiological state of the user; an awareness in the moment of being immersed in a virtual world while having a temporary amnesia or agnosia of the real world and the technical medium of the experience. When present, the user does not attend to and perceive the technology, but instead attends to and perceives the objects, events, and characters the technology represents. Users who feel highly present consider the experience specified by VR technology to be a place visited rather than simply something perceived.</p>
<p class="indent">Presence is a function of both the user and immersion. Immersion is capable of producing the sense of presence but immersion does not always induce presence&#8212;users can simply shut their eyes and imagine being somewhere else. Presence is, however, limited by immersion; the greater immersion a system/application provides then the greater potential for a user to feel present in that virtual world.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_47"></a>A <strong>break-in-presence</strong> is a moment when the illusion generated by a virtual environment breaks down and the user finds himself where he truly is&#8212;in the real world wearing an HMD [<a href="reference.html#ref289"><span class="blue">Slater and Steed 2000</span></a>]. These breaks-in-presence can destroy a VR experience and should be avoided as much as possible. Example causes of a break-in-presence include loss of tracking, a person speaking from the real world that is not part of the virtual environment, tripping on a wire, a real-world phone ringing, etc.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev4.3"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">4.3</span></span> Illusions of Presence</h3>
<p class="noindent">Presence induced by technology-driven immersion can be considered a form of illusion (Section <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2"><span class="blue">6.2</span></a>) since in VR stimuli are just a form of energy projected onto our receptors; e.g., pixels on a screen or audio recorded from a different time and place. Different researchers distinguish different forms of presence in different ways. Presence is divided below into four core components that are merely illusions of a nonexistent reality.</p>
<h4 class="h4">The Illusion of Being in a Stable Spatial Place</h4>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg47lev1"></a>Feeling as if one is in a physical environment is the most important part of presence. This is a subset of what Slater calls &#8220;place illusion&#8221; [<a href="reference.html#ref286"><span class="blue">Slater 2009</span></a>], and it occurs due to all of a user&#8217;s sensory modalities being congruent such that stimuli presented to that user (ideally with no encumbrances such as no restrictions on field of view, no cables pulling on the head, and the freedom to move around) behave as if those stimuli originated from real-world objects in 3D space. Depth cues (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>) are especially important for providing a sense of being at a remote location, and the more depth cues that are consistent with each other the better. This illusion can be broken when the world does not feel stable due to long latency, low frame rate, miscalibration, etc.</p>
<h4 class="h4">The Illusion of Self-Embodiment</h4>
<p class="noindent">We have a lifetime of experience perceiving our own bodies when we look down. Yet many VR experiences contain no personal body&#8212;the user is a disembodied viewpoint in space. <strong>Self-embodiment</strong> is the perception that the user has a body within the virtual world. When disembodied users feel quite present and then are given a virtual body that properly matches their movements, they quickly realize that there are different levels of presence. Then if a user sees a visual object touching the skin while a physical object also touches the skin, presence is greatly strengthened and experienced more deeply (called the rubber hand illusion; <a href="reference.html#ref22"><span class="blue">Botvinick and Cohen 1998</span></a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_48"></a><a id="fig4.1"></a><img src="../images/f0048-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><a id="pg48lev1"></a><span class="blue">Figure 4.1</span> How we perceive ourselves can be quite distorted.</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Surprisingly, the presence of a virtual body can be quite compelling even when that body does not look like one&#8217;s own body. In fact, we don&#8217;t necessarily perceive ourselves objectively and how we perceive ourselves, even in real life, through the lens of our subjectivity can be quite distorted (Figure <a href="chapter04.html#fig4.1"><span class="blue">4.1</span></a>; <a href="reference.html#ref195"><span class="blue">Maltz 1960</span></a>). The mind also automatically associates the visual characteristics of what is seen at the location of the body with one&#8217;s own body. In VR, one can perceive oneself as a cartoon character or someone of a different gender or race, and the experience can still be quite compelling. Research has shown this to be quite effective for teaching empathy by &#8220;walking in someone else&#8217;s shoes&#8221; and can reduce racial bias [<a href="reference.html#ref238"><span class="blue">Peck et al. 2013</span></a>]. Perhaps this is possible due to our being accustomed to changing clothing on a regular basis&#8212;just because our clothes are a different color/texture than our skin or what we were recently wearing does not mean what is underneath those clothes is not our own body. Whereas body shape and color are not so important, motion is extremely important and presence can be broken when visual body motion does not match physical motion in a reasonable manner.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_49"></a>The Illusion of Physical Interaction</h4>
<p class="noindent">Looking around is not enough for people to believe for more than a few seconds that they are in an alternate world. Even if not realistic, adding some form of feedback such as audio, visual highlighting, or a rumble of a controller can give the user a sense that she has in some way touched the world. Ideally, the user should feel a solid physical response that matches the visual representation (as described in Section <a href="chapter03.html#lev3.2.3"><span class="blue">3.2.3</span></a>). As soon as one reaches out to touch something and there is no response, then a break-in-presence can occur. Unfortunately, strong physical feedback can be difficult to attain so sensory substitution (Section <a href="chapter26.html#lev26.8"><span class="blue">26.8</span></a>) is often used instead.</p>
<h4 class="h4">The Illusion of Social Communication</h4>
<p class="noindent">Social presence is the perception that one is really communicating (both verbally and through body language) with other characters (whether computer- or user-controlled) in the same environment. Social realism does not require physical realism. Users have been found to exhibit anxiety responses when causing pain to a relatively low-fidelity virtual character [<a href="reference.html#ref287"><span class="blue">Slater et al. 2006a</span></a>] and when users with a fear of public speaking must talk in front of a low-fidelity virtual audience [<a href="reference.html#ref288"><span class="blue">Slater et al. 2006b</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="pg49lev1"></a>Although social presence does increase as behavioral realism (the degree to which human representations and objects behave as they would in the physical world) increases [<a href="reference.html#ref107"><span class="blue">Guadagno et al. 2007</span></a>], even tracking and rendering only a few points on human players can be quite compelling (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.9"><span class="blue">9.3.9</span></a>). Figure <a href="chapter04.html#fig4.2"><span class="blue">4.2</span></a> shows a screenshot of the multiplayer VR game Arena by NextGen Interactions where the player&#8217;s head and both hands are directly controlled (i.e., three tracked points) and lower-body turning/walking/running animations are indirectly controlled with analog sticks on Sixense Razer Hydra Controllers.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev4.4"></a><span class="font"><span class="blue">4.4</span></span> Reality Trade-Offs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some consider real reality the gold standard of what we are trying to achieve with VR whereas others consider reality a goal to surpass&#8212;for if we can only get to the point of matching reality, then what is the point? This section discusses the trade-offs of trying to replicate reality vs. creating more abstract experiences.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev4.4.1"></a><span class="font1"><span class="blue">4.4.1</span></span> The Uncanny Valley</h4>
<p class="noindent">Some people say robots and computer-generated characters come across as creepy. Although our sense of familiarity with simulated characters representing real characters increases as we get closer to reality, this is only up to a point. If reality is approached, but not attained, some of our reactions shift from empathy to revulsion. This descent <a id="pg50lev1"></a>into creepiness is known as the <strong>Uncanny Valley</strong>, as first proposed by Masahiro <a href="reference.html#ref224"><span class="blue">Mori</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref224"><span class="blue">1970</span></a>]. Figure <a href="chapter04.html#fig4.3"><span class="blue">4.3</span></a> shows a graph of observers&#8217; comfort level with virtual humans as a function of human realism. Observer comfort increases as a character becomes more human-like up until a certain point at which observers start to feel uncomfortable with the almost, but not quite, human character.</p>

<p class="indent">The Uncanny Valley is a controversial topic that is more a simple explanatory theory rather than backed by scientific evidence. However, there is power in simplicity and the theory helps us to think about how to design and give character to VR entities. Creating cartoon characters often yields superior results over creating near-photorealistic humans. Section <a href="chapter22.html#lev22.5"><span class="blue">22.5</span></a> discusses such issues in further detail.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev4.4.2"></a><span class="font1"><span class="blue">4.4.2</span></span> Fidelity Continua</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Uncanny Valley of character creepiness is not the only case of things being close to reality not necessarily being better. The goal of VR is not necessarily to replicate reality. Contrary to what one might initially think, presence does not require photorealism and there are more important presence-inducing cues such as responsiveness of the system, character motion, and depth cues. Simple worlds consisting of basic structures that provide a sense of spatial stability can be extremely compelling, and making worlds more photorealistic does not necessarily increase presence [<a href="reference.html#ref346"><span class="blue">Zimmons and Panter 2003</span></a>]. Being in a cartoon world can feel as real as a world captured by 3D scanners.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_51"></a><a id="fig4.3"></a><img src="../images/f0051-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><a id="pg51lev1"></a><strong><span class="blue">Figure 4.3</span> The Uncanny Valley.</strong> (Based on <a href="reference.html#ref122"><span class="blue">Ho and MacDorman</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref122"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indent">Highly presence-inducing experiences can be ranked on different continua, and one extreme on each continuum is not necessarily better than the other extreme. What points on the continua VR creators choose depends upon the vision and goals of the project.</p>
<p class="indent">Listed below are some VR fidelity continua that VR creators should consider.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Representational fidelity</strong> is the degree to which the VR experience conveys a place that is, or could be, on Earth. At the high end of this spectrum is photorealistic immersive film in which the real world is captured with depth cameras and microphones, then re-created in VR. At the extreme low end of the spectrum are purely abstract or non-objective worlds (e.g., blobs of color and strange sounds). These may have no reference to the real world, simply conveying emotions, exploring pure visual events, or presenting other non-narrative qualities (Paul Mlyniec, personal communication, April 28, 2015). Cartoon worlds and abstract video games are somewhere in the middle depending on how closely the scene and characters represent the real world and its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_52"></a><strong>Interaction fidelity</strong> is the degree to which physical actions for a virtual task correspond to physical actions for the equivalent real-world task (Section <a href="chapter26.html#lev26.1"><span class="blue">26.1</span></a>). On one end of this spectrum are physical training tasks where low interaction fidelity risks negative training effects (Section <a href="chapter15.html#lev15.1.4"><span class="blue">15.1.4</span></a>). At the other extreme are interaction techniques that require no physical motion beyond a button press. Magical techniques are somewhere in the middle where users are able to do things they are not able to do in the real world such as grabbing objects at a distance.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Experiential fidelity</strong> is the degree to which the user&#8217;s personal experience matches the intended experience of the VR creator (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.1"><span class="blue">20.1</span></a>). A VR application that closely conveys what the creator intended has high experiential fidelity. A free-roaming world where endless possibilities exist and every usage results in a different experience has low experiential fidelity.</p>
