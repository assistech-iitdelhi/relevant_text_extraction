<p class="chblock"><em>The best way to predict the future is to create it</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Alan Kay</p>
<p class="noindent">VR technology is moving at lightning speed. It was only in 2011 when most people outside of academics, corporate research, and science fiction communities thought VR was an obsolete joke. Fast-forward to today where thousands of independent developers, start-ups, and Fortune 500 companies are creating VR experiences, positioning themselves as VR leaders. The message is clear: If a company wants to be competitive there is no time to waste on writing the perfect project plan lest they risk being left behind. It&#8217;s a new world, one where the prototype should have been completed last week and informal feedback from an initial demo should have happened yesterday. Yes, spend some time on the Define Stage of the project. But spend a couple of days versus a month on the initial plan before building something. Or better yet jump straight to the Make Stage. Having no software development experience is no excuse&#8212;basic prototypes can be built with today&#8217;s tools by pointing and clicking with a mouse. The content need not be novel&#8212;this is just for you to get started. Experiment by looking around, then modify and experiment with a few things. Then move back to the Define Stage by sketching some ideas out on paper. After all, if a teenager with no budget can build a basic VR experience that his friends and family are impressed by, then an adult committed to changing the future can do the same. Anyone who can&#8217;t put together a basic plan, spend a few hundred dollars on hardware, create a prototype experience (or better yet, do so by working with a colleague or friend), and demonstrate that prototype to some acquaintances for feedback is not yet serious about positioning themselves as a leader of the VR movement. For those of you who are ready, <strong>welcome to the new reality!</strong></p>
<p class="indent">Here is a very reasonable schedule for someone who can build VR experiences <em>part-time in little as a few hours per week</em>. If you have somehow managed to arrange your life or convinced your boss to do this full-time, then the limiting factor will be the arrival <a id="page_486"></a>of the hardware. If you have experience in software development, then you can easily condense this schedule to under a week. So stop making excuses and <strong>get to work!</strong></p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 1</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Find and attend a local VR Meetup (<span class="weblink"><a href="http://vr.meetup.com"><span class="blue">http://vr.meetup.com</span></a></span>). Try some demos and talk to as many people as possible. Get to know those who are also serious about developing VR experiences. Collect their contact information.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Order an HMD.</p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 2</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>While waiting for the hardware to arrive, download Unity (it is free for individuals or companies making under $100K/year) or your development tool of choice.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Search online for some non-VR tutorials and start working through them in order to become comfortable with the core tools (even if you don&#8217;t plan on being a developer, you should know the basics).</p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 3</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Once the HMD arrives, follow the directions that came with the HMD. Try the manufacturer&#8217;s basic demos.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Find and download some different VR experiences. Note what you like and don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 4</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Using Unity or your tool of choice, add a texture-mapped plane, a cube floating in space, and a light source (I have performed the initial Define Stage for you!).</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Build the application, put on the HMD, and look around.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Take off the HMD and modify the scene. Build and put on the HMD, noticing how things have changed.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Congratulations, you have performed the most basic form of the define-make-experiment iteration in perhaps a couple of hours. It doesn&#8217;t matter how bad it is at this point, you are learning fast.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Now iterate some more!</p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 5</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Write a basic concept for your first project based on what you liked and didn&#8217;t like about the experiences you tried and your first scene that you built. Be creative.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><a id="page_487"></a><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Don&#8217;t worry about details such as requirements, constraints, and task analysis yet. That can come later.</p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 6</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Build some low-level functionality for your basic concept. Don&#8217;t worry about the art yet. Remember this is a prototype to test your ideas.</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Show to friends, family, and people you met at the meetup. Get their feedback of what works and what doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p class="indentbullett"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/> Week 7 and beyond</p>
<p class="bulletsquare"><img src="../images/square.jpg" alt="image"/><span class="spaceb"/>Iterate. Iterate. Iterate. For each iteration, expand upon each stage or start completely over at any time. Then repeat Week 7.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Congratulations&#8212;you are now a VR creator and a contributor to the VR revolution! This is not the end, for it is only the beginning.</strong></p>
