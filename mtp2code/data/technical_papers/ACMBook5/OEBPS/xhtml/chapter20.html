<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">High-Level Concepts of Content Creation</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Virtual worlds would be very lonely places without content. This chapter discusses general high-level tips on creating content&#8212;creating a compelling story, focusing on the core experiences, keeping the integrity of the world consistent, and gestalt principles of perceptual organization.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev20.1"></a><a id="pg225lev1"></a><span class="font">20.1</span> <strong>Experiencing the Story</strong></h3>
<p class="chblock"><em>We need to consider a user&#8217;s experiential arc through time. Virtual worlds can be intense or contemplative, ideally experiences oscillate between these, thus giving the author the ability to punctuate story elements with different design elements of VR</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Mark Bolas (personal communication, June 13, 2015)</p>
<p class="indent">In traditional media ranging from plays to books to film to games, stories are compelling because they resonate with the audience&#8217;s experiences. VR is extremely experiential and users can become part of a story more so than with any other form of media. However, simply telling a story using VR does not automatically qualify it to be an engaging experience&#8212;it must be done well and in a way that resonates with the user.</p>
<p class="indent">To convey a story, all of the details do not need to be presented. Users will fill in the gaps with their imaginations. People give meaning to even the most basic shapes and motions. For example, <a href="reference.html#ref116"><span class="blue">Heider and Simmel</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref116"><span class="blue">1944</span></a>] created a two-and-a-half-minute video of some lines, a small circle, a small triangle, and a large triangle (Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.1"><span class="blue">20.1</span></a>). The circle and triangles moved around both inside the lines and outside the lines, and sometimes touched each other. Participants were simply told &#8220;write down what happened in the picture.&#8221; One participant gave the following story.</p>
<p class="blockquotet"><a id="page_226"></a>A man has planned to meet a girl and the girl comes along with another man. The first man tells the second to go; the second tells the first, and he shakes his head. Then the two men have a fight, and the girl starts to go into the room to get out of the way and hesitates and finally goes in. She apparently does not want to be with the first man. The first man follows her into the room after having left the second in a rather weakened condition leaning on the wall outside the room. The girl gets worried and races from one corner to the other in the far part of the room&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
<p class="indentt">All 34 participants created stories with 33 participants interpreting the actions of the geometric shapes as animate beings. Only one participant created a story consisting of geometric shapes. What is most surprising, however, is how similar some parts of their stories were. The 33 subjects who had stories about animate beings all stated similar things for specific points in the animation: two characters had a fight, one character was shut in some structure and tries to get out, and one character chased another.</p>
<p class="indent">VR creators will never be able to take the subjectivity out of a story experience. Users will always distort any stimuli presented to them based on their filters of the values, <a id="pg226lev1"></a>beliefs, memories, etc. (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.9.3"><span class="blue">7.9.3</span></a>). However, the above experiment suggests that in some cases, even simple cues can provide fairly consistent interpretations. Although we can&#8217;t control exactly how users will make up all the details of the story in their own mind, content creators can lead the mind through suggestion. Content creators should focus on the most important aspects of the story and attempt to make them consistently interpreted across users.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.1</span> A frame from a simple geometric animation. Subjects came up with quite elaborate stories based on the animation.</strong> (From <a href="reference.html#ref116"><span class="blue">Heider and Simmel</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref116"><span class="blue">1944</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_227"></a><strong>Experiential fidelity</strong> is the degree to which the user&#8217;s personal experience matches the intended experience of the VR creator [<a href="reference.html#ref184"><span class="blue">Lindeman and Beckhaus 2009</span></a>]. Experiential fidelity can be increased by better technology, but is also increased through everything that goes with the technology. For example, priming users before they enter the virtual world can structure anticipation and expectation in a way that will increase the impact of what is presented. Prior to the exposure, give the user a backstory about what is about to occur. The mind provides far better fidelity than any technology can, and the mind must be tapped to provide quality experiences. Providing perfect realism is not necessary if enough clues are provided for them to fill in the details with their imagination. Note experiential fidelity for all parts of the experience is not always the goal. A social free-roaming world can allow users to create their own stories&#8212;perhaps the content creator simply provides the meta-story where users create their own personal stories within.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Skeuomorphism</strong> is the incorporation of old, familiar ideas into new technologies, <a id="pg227lev1"></a>even though the ideas no longer play a functional role [<a href="reference.html#ref230"><span class="blue">Norman 2013</span></a>]. This can be important for a wide majority of people who may be more resistant to change than early adopters. If designed to match the real world, VR experiences can be more acceptable than other technologies because of the lower learning curve&#8212;one interacts in a similar way to the real world rather than having to learn a new interface and new expectations. Then real-world metaphors can be incorporated into the story, gradually teaching how to interact and move through the world in new ways. Eventually, even conservative users will be open to more magical interactions (Section <a href="chapter26.html#lev26.1"><span class="blue">26.1</span></a>) that have less relationship to the old, through skeuomorphic designs that help with the gradual transition.</p>
<p class="indent">In June of 2008, approximately 50 leading VR researchers at the &#8220;Designing the Experience&#8221; session at the Dagstuhl Seminar on Virtual Realities identified four primary attributes that characterize great experiences [<a href="reference.html#ref184"><span class="blue">Lindeman and Beckhaus 2009</span></a>] as described below. To achieve the best experiences, shoot for the following concepts through powerful storytelling and sensory input.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Strong emotion</strong> can cover a range of emotions and feeling of extremes. These include any strong feeling such as joy, excitement, and surprise that occurs without conscious effort. Strong emotions result from anticipating an event, achieving a goal, or fulfilling a childhood dream. Most people are more aroused by and interested in emotional stories than logical stories. Stories aimed at emotions distract from the limits of technology.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_228"></a><strong>Deep engagement</strong> occurs when users are in the moment and experience a state of flow as described by <a href="reference.html#ref54"><span class="blue">Csikszentmihalyi</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref54"><span class="blue">2008</span></a>]. Engaged users are extremely focused on the experience, losing track of space and time. Users become hyper-sensitive, with a heightened awareness without distraction.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Massive stimulation</strong> occurs when there is a sensory input across all the modalities, with each sense receiving a large amount of stimulation. The entire body is immersed and feels the experience in multiple ways. The stimulation should be congruent with the story.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Escape from reality</strong> is being psychologically removed from the real world. There is a lack of demands of the real world and the people in it. Users fully experience the story when not paying attention to sensory cues from the real world or the passage of time.</p>
<p class="indentt">VR does not exist in isolation. Disney understands this extremely well. Over a period of 14 months in the mid-1990s, approximately 45,000 users experienced the Aladdin attraction, which used VR as a medium to tell stories [<a href="reference.html#ref237"><span class="blue">Pausch et al. 1996</span></a>]. The authors <a id="pg228lev1"></a>came to the following conclusions.</p>
<p class="indentbullett">&#8226; Those not familiar with VR are unimpressed with technology. Focus on the entire experience instead of the technology.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide a relatable background story before immersing users into the virtual world.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make the story simple and clear.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on content, why users are there, and what there is to do.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide a specific goal to perform.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on believability instead of photorealism.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Keep the experience tame enough for the most sensitive users.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Minimize breaks-in-presence such as interpenetrating objects and characters not responding to the user.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Like film, VR appeals to everyone but content may segment the market, so focus on the targeted audience.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev20.2"></a><span class="font">20.2</span> <strong>The Core Experience</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The <strong>core experience</strong> is the essential moment-to-moment activity of users making meaningful choices resulting in meaningful feedback. Even though the overall VR <a id="page_229"></a>experience might contain an array of various contexts and constraints, the core experience should remain the same. Because the core experience is so essential, it should be the primary focus of VR creators to make that core experience pleasurable so users stay engaged and want to come back for more.</p>
<p class="indent">A hypothetical example is a VR ping-pong game. A traditional ping-pong game very much has a core experience of continuously competing via simple actions that can be improved upon over time. A VR game might go well beyond a traditional real-world ping-pong game via adding obstacles, providing extra points for bouncing the ball differently, increasing the difficulty, presenting different background art, rewarding the player with a titanium racquet, etc. However, the core experience of hitting the ping-pong ball still remains. If that core experience is not implemented well so that it is enjoyable, then no number of fancy features will keep users engaged for more than a couple of minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Even for a serious non-game application, making the core experience pleasurable is just as crucial for users to think of it as more than just an interesting demo, and to continue using the system. <strong>Gamification</strong> is, at least in part, about taking what <a id="pg229lev1"></a>some people consider mundane tasks and making the core of that task enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding.</p>
<p class="indent">Determining what the core experience is and making it enjoyable is where creativity is required. However, that creativity rarely results in the core experience being enjoyable on a first implementation. Instead VR creators must continuously improve upon the core experience, build various prototype experiences focused on that core, and learn from observing and collecting data from real users. These concepts are covered in Part <span class="blue">VI</span>.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev20.3"></a><span class="font">20.3</span> <strong>Conceptual Integrity</strong></h3>
<p class="chblock"><em>No style will appeal to everyone; a mishmash of styles delights no one&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;Somehow consistency brings clarity, and clarity brings delight</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">2010</span></a>]</p>
<p class="indent">Brooks argues in the <em>Mythical Man-Month</em> [<a href="reference.html#ref36"><span class="blue">Brooks 1995</span></a>] &#8220;conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.&#8221; This is even more so with VR content creation. <strong>Conceptual integrity</strong> is also known as coherence, consistency, and sometimes uniformity of style [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">The basic structure of the virtual world should be directly evident and self-explanatory so users can immediately understand and start experiencing and using the world. <a id="page_230"></a>There might be complexity added as users become experts, but the core conceptual model should be the same.</p>
<p class="indent">Extraneous content and features that are immaterial to the experience, even if good, should be left out. It is better to have one good idea that carries through the entire experience than to have several loosely related good ideas. If there are many but incompatible ideas where the sum of those ideas is better than the existing primary concept, then the primary concept should be reconsidered to provide an overarching theme that encompasses all of the best ideas in a coherent manner.</p>
<p class="indent">The best artists and designers create conceptual integrity with consistent conscious and subconscious decisions. How can conceptual integrity be enforced when the project is complex enough to require a team? Empower a single individual director who controls the basic concepts and has a clear passionate vision to direct the project&#8217;s vision and content.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>director</strong> primarily acts as an agent to serve the users of the experience, but also serves to fulfill the project goals and to direct the team in focusing on the right things. The director takes input and suggestions from the team but is the final decision maker on the concepts and what the experience will be. She leads many steps in defining the project (Chapter <a href="chapter31.html#ch31"><span class="blue">31</span></a>). However, the director is not a dictator of how implementation will occur (Chapter <a href="chapter32.html#ch32"><span class="blue">32</span></a>) or how feedback will be collected from users (Chapter <a href="chapter33.html#ch33"><span class="blue">33</span></a>), but instead suggests to and takes suggestions from those working in those stages. The director should always be prepared to show an example implementation, even if not an ideal implementation, of how his ideas might be implemented. Even if the makers and data collectors accept the director&#8217;s suggestions, then the director should give credit to them.</p>
<p class="indent">Makers and data collectors should have immediate access to the director to make sure the right things are being implemented and measured. Questions and communication should be highly encouraged. This communication should be maintained throughout the project as the project definition will change and assumptions may drift apart as the project evolves.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev20.4"></a><span class="font">20.4</span> <strong>Gestalt Perceptual Organization</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Gestalt is a German word that roughly translates into English as <em>configuration</em>. The central principle of <strong>gestalt psychology</strong> states that perception depends on a number of organizing principles, which determine how we perceive objects and the world. This principle maintains that the human mind considers objects in their entirety before, or in parallel with, perception of their individual parts, suggesting the whole is different than the sum of its parts. Gestalt psychology is even more important for VR <a id="page_231"></a>as compared to pictures alone as the best VR applications bring together all the senses into a cohesive experience that could not be obtained by one sensory modality alone.</p>
<p class="indent">The gestalt effect is the capability of our brain to generate whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures, instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements such as points, lines, and polygons. As demonstrated in Section <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2"><span class="blue">6.2</span></a> and with every VR session anyone has ever experienced, we are pattern-recognizing machines seeing things that do not exist.</p>
<p class="indent">Perceptual organization involves two processes: grouping and segregation. Grouping is the process by which stimuli are put together into units or objects. Segregation is the process of separating one area or object from another.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev20.4.1"></a><span class="font1">20.4.1</span> <strong>Principles of Grouping</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Gestalt groupings</strong> are rules of how we naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, enabling us to form some degree of order from the chaos of individual components.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>principle of simplicity</strong> states that figures tend to be perceived in their simplest <a id="pg231lev1"></a>form instead of complicated shapes. As can be seen in Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.2"><span class="blue">20.2</span></a>, perception of an object being 3D varies depending on the simplicity of its 2D projection; the simpler the 2D interpretation, the more likely that figure will be perceived as 2D. At a higher level, we tend to recognize 3D objects even if they are not realistic. The hydrant in Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.3"><span class="blue">20.3</span></a> is intentionally bent in an unrealistic manner to provide character, but we still perceive it as a simple recognizable object instead of abstract individual components.</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>principle of continuity</strong> states aligned elements tend to be perceived as a single group or chunk, and are interpreted as being more related than unaligned elements. Points that form patterns are seen as belonging together, and the lines tend to be seen in such a way as to follow the smoothest path. An &#8220;X&#8221; symbol or two crossing lines (Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.4"><span class="blue">20.4</span></a>) are perceived as two lines that cross instead of angled parts. Our brains automatically and subconsciously integrate cues as whole objects that are most likely to be in reality. Objects that are partially covered by other objects are also seen as continuing behind the covering object, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.5"><span class="blue">20.5</span></a>.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="fig20.2"></a><img src="../images/f0231-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.2</span> The principle of simplicity states that figures tend to be perceived in their simplest form, whether that is 3D (a) or 2D (d).</strong> (From <a href="reference.html#ref178"><span class="blue">Lehar</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref178"><span class="blue">2007</span></a>])</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.4</span> The principle of continuity states that elements tend to be perceived as following the most aligned or smoothest path.</strong> (Based on <a href="reference.html#ref338"><span class="blue">Wolfe</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref338"><span class="blue">2006</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>principle of proximity</strong> states that elements that are close to one another tend to be perceived as a shape or group (Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.6"><span class="blue">20.6</span></a>). Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are radically different from each other, they will appear as a group if they are close together. Society evolved by using proximity to create written language. Words are groups of letters, which are perceived as words because they are spaced close together in a deliberate way. While learning to read, one recognizes words not only by individual letters but by the grouping of those letters into larger recognizable patterns. Proximity is also important when creating graphical user interfaces, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.7"><span class="blue">20.7</span></a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.5</span> The blue geometry connecting the two yellow 3D cursors are perceived as being connected even when occluded by the cubic object. The &#8220;poker&#8221; part of the left cursor is also perceived as continuing through the cube.</strong> (From [<a href="reference.html#ref340"><span class="blue">Yoganandan et al. 2014</span></a>])</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.6</span> The principle of proximity states that elements close together tend to be perceived as a shape or group.</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>principle of similarity</strong> states that elements with similar properties tend to be perceived as being grouped together (Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.8"><span class="blue">20.8</span></a>). Similarity depends on form, color, size, and brightness of the elements. Similarity helps us organize objects into groups in realistic scenes or abstract art scenes, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.9"><span class="blue">20.9</span></a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.7</span> The panel in MakeVR uses the principles of proximity and similiarity to group different user interface elements together (drop-down menu items, tool icons, boolean operations, and apply-to options).</strong> (Courtesy of Sixense)</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.8</span> The principle of similarity states that elements with similar properties tend to be perceived as being grouped together.</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>principle of closure</strong> states that when a shape is not closed, the shape tends to be perceived as being a whole recognizable figure or object (Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.10"><span class="blue">20.10</span></a>). Our brains do everything to perceive incomplete objects and shapes as whole recognizable objects, even if that means filling in empty space with imaginary lines such as in the Kanizsa illusion (Section <a href="chapter06.html#lev6.2.2"><span class="blue">6.2.2</span></a>). When the viewer&#8217;s perception completes a shape, closure occurs.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Temporal closure</strong> is used with film, animation, and games. When a character begins a journey and then suddenly in the next scene the character arrives at his destination, then the mind fills the time between those scenes&#8212;we don&#8217;t need to watch the entire journey. A similar concept is used in immersive games and film. At shorter timescales, apparent motion can be perceived when in fact no motion occurred or the screen is blank between displayed frames (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.6"><span class="blue">9.3.6</span></a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.10</span> The principle of closure states that when a shape is not closed, the shape tends to be perceived as being a whole recognizable figure or object.</strong></p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>principle of common fate</strong> states that elements moving together tend to be perceived as grouped, even if they are in a larger, more complex group (Figure <a href="chapter20.html#fig20.11"><span class="blue">20.11</span></a>). Common fate applies not only to groups of moving elements but also to the form of objects. For example, common fate helps to perceive depth of objects when moving the head through motion parallax (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.1.3"><span class="blue">9.1.3</span></a>).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_236"></a><a id="fig20.11"></a><img src="../images/f0236-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 20.11</span> The principle of common fate states that elements moving in a common way (signified by arrows) tend to be perceived as being grouped together.</strong></p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev20.4.2"></a><span class="font1">20.4.2</span> <strong>Segregation</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The perceptual separation of one object from another is known as <strong>segregation.</strong> The question of what what is the foreground and what is the background is often referred to as the <strong>figure-ground problem</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">Objects tend to stand out from their background. In perceptual segregation terms, a <strong>figure</strong> is a group of contours that has some kind of object-like properties in our consciousness. The <strong>ground</strong> that is the background is perceived to extend behind a figure. Borders between figure and ground appear to be part of the figure (known as ownership).</p>
<p class="indent">Figures have distinct form whereas ground has less form and contrast. Figures appear brighter or darker than equivalent patches of light that form part of the ground. Figures are seen as richer, are more meaningful, and are remembered more easily. A figure has the characteristics of a &#8220;thing,&#8221; more apt to suggest meaning, whereas the ground has less conscious meaning but acts as a stable reference that serves as a rest frame for motion perception (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.4"><span class="blue">12.3.4</span></a>). Stimuli perceived as figures are processed in greater detail than stimuli perceived as ground.</p>
<p class="indent">Various factors affect whether observers view stimuli as figure or ground. Objects tend to be convex and thus convex shapes are more likely to be perceived as figure. Areas lower in the scene are more likely to be perceived as ground. Familiar shapes that represent objects are more likely to be seen as figure. Depth cues such as partial occlusions/interposition, linear perspective, binocular disparity, motion parallax, etc. can have significant impact on what we perceive as figure and ground. Figures are more likely to be perceived as objects and signifiers (Section <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.2.2"><span class="blue">25.2.2</span></a>), giving us clues that the form can be interacted with.</p>
