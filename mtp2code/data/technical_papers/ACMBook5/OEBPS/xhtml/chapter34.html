<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Iterative Design: Design Guidelines</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Designing iteratively is more important for VR than for any other medium due to there being so many unknowns. Do not expect to find or create a single overall detailed VR design process that works across all types of VR projects. Instead, learn the different processes to know when they are most appropriate to use. Focus on continuous iteration of defining the project, making the application, and learning from users.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev34.1"></a><strong><span class="font">34.1</span> Philosophy of Iterative Design (Chapter <a href="chapter30.html#ch30"><span class="blue">30</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<h4 class="h4a"><strong>Human-Centered Design (Section <a href="chapter30.html#lev30.2"><span class="blue">30.2</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on the user experience.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Give up traditional measures of software development such as lines of code.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Continuous Discovery through Iteration (Section <a href="chapter30.html#lev30.3"><span class="blue">30.3</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Give up on knowing and rationalizing everything from the start.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Collect feedback as quickly and as often as possible from experts and representative users.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Fail early and fail often in order to learn as quickly and as much as possible.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If failure is not occurring often in early iterations, then attempt to innovate more.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Always be on the lookout for changes in assumptions, technology, and business. Then change course as necessary.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Step into the role of the user and try a broad range of VR experiences.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; There is more value in getting a bad prototype working than spending days thinking, considering, and debating.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_454"></a>&#8226; Create a culture of accepting failure, especially early in the project to create a feeling that it is safe to experiment.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Regard feedback and measurement from real application above opinion based on theory.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>There Is No One Way&#8212;Processes Are Project Dependent (Section <a href="chapter30.html#lev30.4"><span class="blue">30.4</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Prioritize team members and communication between team members over sticking to a formal process.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Prioritize responding to change over following a plan.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If it is not clear what processes to go with, then just pick some and go with them. Then iterate on improving them or change the processes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not become attached to processes. Be willing to throw them away if they are not working.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Teams (Section <a href="chapter30.html#lev30.5"><span class="blue">30.5</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Keep teams small to maximize communication.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If the team starts to become large, then break into smaller teams.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make sure everyone is on board with the team philosophy.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; All team members should actively co-create, not just critique.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Create a culture of learning from other team members, external suggestions from those experienced with VR, other disciplines, and user feedback.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If any team member is close minded to ideas that are not his own, warn him and if he doesn&#8217;t change remove him from the project as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Collect input from a wide range of opinions and viewpoints but do not make decisions by committee.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Assign an authoritative director who listens well but acts as a final decision maker on high-level items.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If it is too difficult for a single person (the director) to understand how everything is connected, then the design is overcomplicated. Simplify the design.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev34.2"></a><strong><span class="font">34.2</span> The Define Stage (Chapter <a href="chapter31.html#ch31"><span class="blue">31</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not spend too much time on the Define Stage in the first iteration.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be careful of analysis paralysis of trying to figure everything out before pulling the trigger.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_455"></a>&#8226; If not sure about moving on to the Make Stage, then move on to the Make Stage. Return to the Define Stage at a later time.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; In addition to documenting <em>what</em> decisions are made, document <em>why</em> decisions are made.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>The Vision (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.1"><span class="blue">31.1</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If some aspect of the project is unknown then guess. Articulated guesses beat unspoken or vague models.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Questions (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.2"><span class="blue">31.2</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Get input from multiple individuals including all teammates, stakeholders, representative users, other teams, business developers, marketers, and expert consultants.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Don&#8217;t expect others to straight out tell you what they want. Help them discover what they want by asking questions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Ask questions that start with the word &#8220;why.&#8221;</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Remember customers don&#8217;t want an HMD, they want an experience and/or results.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Understand more than just the VR aspect of the project. Understand the background and context of the project.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Assessment and Feasibility (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.3"><span class="blue">31.3</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not assume VR is the right solution for every problem.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider having the project consist of a mix of both VR and the real world.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>High-Level Design Considerations (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.4"><span class="blue">31.4</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Decide if you are focusing on design <em>with, for</em>, or <em>of</em> virtual environments.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Objectives (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.5"><span class="blue">31.5</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on benefits and outcomes instead of features.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When creating objectives, use the SMART acronym&#8212;Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Key Players (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.6"><span class="blue">31.6</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; All key players should be in agreement with the vision, really care about the project, and be committed to its success.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_456"></a>&#8226; Understand that many people may not have an interest no matter how good of a fit you think they might be. Listen to what they have to say and move on. Do not waste time chasing such individuals.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Time and Costs (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.7"><span class="blue">31.7</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When negotiating contracts, separate out initial assessment and feasibility from implementation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider using milestones where additional payment is only received after achieving agreed-upon milestones.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Remember Brooks&#8217; Law&#8212;adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Play planning poker to estimate development effort.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Understand developers tend to overestimate their abilities even when they know they overestimate their abilities.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Risks (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.8"><span class="blue">31.8</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Explicitly identify risk to bring awareness of any danger that might affect the project so that appropriate action can be taken to mitigate that risk.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on minimizing controllable risk.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To reduce risk, make projects as short as possible. If a project is large, break it down into smaller subprojects.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Assumptions (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.9"><span class="blue">31.9</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Explicitly look for and declare assumptions so all team members begin from a common starting point.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be bold and precise in listing assumptions even when not sure. Wrong assumptions can be tested, vague assumptions cannot.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Prioritize assumptions to test the riskiest assumptions first.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Project Constraints (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.10"><span class="blue">31.10</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make a single individual responsible for tracking and controlling constraints, with transparency to the entire team.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Explicitly list constraints to narrow the design space.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_457"></a><a id="fig34.1"></a><img src="../images/f0457-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 34.1</span> A solution to Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.8"><span class="blue">31.8</span></a> of using only a single line to cover all nine dots. The problem never stated a limit to the width of the line.</strong></p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Divide constraints into real constraints, resource constraints, obsolete constraints, misperceived constraints, indirect constraints, and intentional artificial constraints.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Think outside the box by listing all misperceived constraints. Figure <a href="chapter34.html#fig34.1"><span class="blue">34.1</span></a> shows a solution to Figure <a href="chapter31.html#fig31.8"><span class="blue">31.8</span></a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Personas (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.11"><span class="blue">31.11</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Making generalizations to all people makes building a VR experience difficult. Target personas to make the design easier.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Validate and modify personas on later iterations as more is learned about those actually using the system.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For applications where personas are especially important (e.g., therapy applications), collect data with interviews and questionnaires.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>User Stories (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.12"><span class="blue">31.12</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Write user stories in the form &#8220;As a &#60;type of user&#62; I want &#60;some goal&#62; so that &#60;some reason&#62;&#8221; to define who, what, and why.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Create user stories that consist of the INVEST acronym: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Storyboards (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.13"><span class="blue">31.13</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Show users directly interacting in storyboards without worrying about screen layout details since the screen perceptually goes away with fully immersive VR.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_458"></a>&#8226; Don&#8217;t limit storyboards to be linear. Storyboard frames might be connected in multiple ways.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Scope (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.14"><span class="blue">31.14</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; In addition to stating what will be done, explicitly state what will not be done so that the team can focus on what is important.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Requirements (Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.15"><span class="blue">31.15</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Requirements convey expectations of the customer; have the client and/or other key players actively involved in defining requirements.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Requirements should be written in language that can be easily understood by all parties involved.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Each requirement should be a single thing the application should do.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Each requirement should be complete, verifiable, and concise, yet with room for innovation and change.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Any attempt to formulate all possible requirements at the start of a project will fail and would cause considerable delays.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Work with the client and/or partners when changes are necessary.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Include universal requirements such as fading the screen out when latency rises above some threshold or when tracking is lost.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev34.3"></a><strong><span class="font">34.3</span> The Make Stage (Chapter <a href="chapter32.html#ch32"><span class="blue">32</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Makers should not develop VR applications without full access to VR hardware.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use existing frameworks and tools unless there is a good reason not to do so.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Task Analysis (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.1"><span class="blue">32.1</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Task analysis provides organization and structure for description of user activities, which make it easier to describe how activities fit together.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use task analysis to understand what tasks must be carried out, to document descriptions of activities, and to look for how to improve processes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When the goal is to replicate actions in the real world (e.g., training applications), start with the real-world task instead of the not-yet-created VR task.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Find representative users by looking for users who match previously created personas.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_459"></a>&#8226; Interview users, domain experts, and visionary representatives to gain insight into what users need and expect.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Administrate questionnaires, observe experts in action, review existing documentation, and observe VR users trying prototypes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Carefully think about each stage of the cycle of interaction.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Ask &#8220;how&#8221; questions to break tasks into subtasks.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Ask &#8220;why&#8221; questions to get high-level task descriptions and context.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Ask what happens before and what happens after to obtain sequential information.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use graphical depictions when talking with those whom information is being extracted from in order to collect higher-quality information.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking there is a perfect way to do task analysis.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; After organizing and structuring the task, review with those users whose information was solicited to verify understanding.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Design Specification (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2"><span class="blue">32.2</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; In the early stages of specifying the design, explore different designs before converging and committing to a final solution.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Sketches (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.1"><span class="blue">32.2.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Good sketches are quick and timely, inexpensive and disposable, plentiful, suggestive and explorative, and partially ambiguous. Sketches also have a distinct gestural style, have an appropriate degree of refinement, and contain minimal detail.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Block Diagrams (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.2"><span class="blue">32.2.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use block diagrams to show the overall relationship of components without concern for the details.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Use Cases (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.3"><span class="blue">32.2.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Define use cases to help identify, clarify, and organize interactions in a way that makes them easier to implement.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Outline use cases with hierarchical levels to provide both high-level and more detailed views. Fill in details as needed.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_460"></a>&#8226; Use color and/or different font types to easily see what needs to be implemented, what has already been implemented/tested, differences between paths, and/or who is assigned to what steps.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Classes (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.3"><span class="blue">32.2.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Organize information with common structure and functionality from earlier steps into themes and then turn those themes into classes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use class diagrams to state what developers need to implement.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Software Design Patterns (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.5"><span class="blue">32.2.5</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Reuse software design patterns to solve commonly occurring software architecture problems.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>System Considerations (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.3"><span class="blue">32.3</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>System Trade-Offs and Making Decisions (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.3.1"><span class="blue">32.3.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Don&#8217;t try to support everything by implementing for the &#8220;average&#8221; option as that will result in no single optimal experience. Instead implement different metaphors and interactions that appropriately fit each option.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Start by supporting single options and optimize them before adding secondary options.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Support of Different Hardware (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.3.2"><span class="blue">32.3.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Attempting to support different hardware classes most often results in the experience being optimized for none of them.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If different hardware classes must be supported, then the core interaction techniques should be independently optimized for each to take advantage of their unique characteristics.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Frame Rate and Latency (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.3.3"><span class="blue">32.3.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Maintain a frame rate from the beginning that matches or exceeds the refresh rate of the HMD.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Carefully observe the frame rate as new assets are added and code complexity increases. Even occasional frame drops can be uncomfortable for users.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not only rely on frame rate to determine latency. Measure end-to-end latency using a latency meter.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page_461"></a><strong>Sickness Guidelines (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.3.4"><span class="blue">32.3.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; It is as important for programmers to respect adverse health effects as it is for anyone on the team even if they are not prone to sickness themselves.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Don&#8217;t wait for the Learn Stage to fix sickness-inducing problems.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Calibration (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.3.4"><span class="blue">32.3.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Enable easy or automatic calibration&#8212;proper calibration is essential.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Simulation (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.4"><span class="blue">32.4</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Separate Simulation from Rendering (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.4.1"><span class="blue">32.4.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Perform rendering asynchronously from simulation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Slow simulation updates are often acceptable as long as rendering from head motion occurs with low latency.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For realistic physics simulations, use a fast update rate.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Fighting Physics (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.4.2"><span class="blue">32.4.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The solution to fighting physics is to not fight. Do not attempt to have two separate policies simultaneously determine where an object is.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Stop applying simulated forces to an object when the object is picked up by the user.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Jittering Objects (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.4.3"><span class="blue">32.4.3)</span></a> and Flying Objects (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.4.4"><span class="blue">32.4.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use physics &#8220;cheats&#8221; to reduce object jittering and objects flying off into space.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Avoid having multiple physically simulated objects interacting whenever possible, especially if the objects are in an enclosed space or are tightly constrained against one another (e.g., a stack of blocks in a small pit or multiple boxes joined together in a circular fashion).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Networked Environments (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5"><span class="blue">32.5</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Ideals of Networked Environments (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.1"><span class="blue">32.5.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on minimizing divergence, causality violations, and expectation violations while maximizing responsiveness and perceived continuity.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page_462"></a><strong>Message Protocols (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.2"><span class="blue">32.5.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use UDP when low latency is a priority, updates occur often, and each update is not essential. Examples of when to use UDP are when continually updating character position and audio.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use TCP when state information is only sent once (or occasionally) to ensure the receiving computer can update its state of the world to match the sender&#8217;s state.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Network Architecture (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.3"><span class="blue">32.5.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For fast responsiveness, use peer-to-peer networking.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To ensure all users&#8217; worlds are consistent, use a fully authoritative server.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use hybrid architectures to take advantage of both peer-to-peer architectures and client-server architectures.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Determinism and Local Estimation (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.4"><span class="blue">32.5.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For partially deterministic actions, use dead reckoning to estimate where remotely controlled entities are currently located.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use interpolation to reduce perceptual discontinuities where objects appear as jumping to new locations when new network packets are received.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Reducing Network Traffic (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.5"><span class="blue">32.5.5</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To reduce network traffic, compute divergence of the local and true state and only send updates when divergence surpasses some threshold. Relevance filtering can also be used to only send relevant information to each computer.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Conduct audio stress tests by having many users speak simultaneously.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use relevance filtering to only send audio to nearby users.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If necessary, allocate less bandwidth to users who are further away or not in the general forward-looking direction.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use animations whenever possible instead of continuous updates.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Simultaneous Interactions (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.6"><span class="blue">32.5.6</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use an object token that can only be owned by a single player at a time to prevent users from simultaneously interacting with the same object.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page_463"></a><strong>Networking Physics (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.5.7"><span class="blue">32.5.7</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When simulating physics across networks, have a single authoritative computer own the simulation (although other computers can estimate the simulation).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Prototypes (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.6"><span class="blue">32.6</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use prototypes to learn from what users do, not just from what they say.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Begin with minimal prototypes, i.e., start with the least amount of work necessary to receive meaningful feedback.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on getting something working as quickly as possible and then modify and add additional functionality/features on to the minimal prototype or restart from scratch.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Have a clear goal for each prototype.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When building minimal prototypes, give up on trying to look good. Expect that it won&#8217;t be done well on the first several attempts.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Forms of Prototypes (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.6.1"><span class="blue">32.6.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; As a first step, consider using real-world prototypes (e.g., physical props and no digital technology) with team members acting out roles.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use Wizard of Oz prototypes where an unseen team member enters commands on a workstation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Get representational user prototypes working as soon as possible and get feedback from as many naive users as possible.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on building the prototype that best collects data for what is being targeted.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Final Production (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.7"><span class="blue">32.7</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When final production begins, stop exploring possibilities and stop adding more features. Save those ideas for a later deliverable.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be open to feedback from stakeholders, but make it clear that there is a limit to what is possible within time and budget constraints. There are trade-offs involved and adding new features may come at the cost of delaying other features.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_464"></a><strong>Delivery (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.8"><span class="blue">32.8</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Demos (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.8.1"><span class="blue">32.8.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Before traveling to give a demo, set the demo up in a room different from where equipment is normally located to make sure no equipment is missed when packing.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Pack two backups of everything!</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Set up in the demo space the day before and confirm everything is working in the morning.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be prepared for in-house demos for when important people show up who can add value to the project. This does not mean anyone should be given a demo at any time; demos can take up valuable resources that could be devoted to the project.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Have a single person be responsible for maintaining and updating in-house demos. Have a single person (possibly the demo maintainer) be responsible for scheduling demos.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Onsite Installation (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.8.2"><span class="blue">32.8.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not expect installation for non-expert VR customers to go smoothly.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For complicated installations with multiple pieces of hardware, be prepared to calibrate, modify source code, and use electrical/gaffer tape. Issues might include electromagnetic interference and incompatible connections/cables with a client&#8217;s system.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Offer a service to train staff in using and maintaining the system. What may be obvious to you may not be obvious to them.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Offer support and updates as part of a contract.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Continuous Delivery (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.8.3"><span class="blue">32.8.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When delivering online, consider offering builds on a weekly basis. This will force the team to be held accountable and to focus on what is important, as well as to provide plenty of opportunity for data collection.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev34.4"></a><strong><span class="font">34.4</span> The Learn Stage (Chapter <a href="chapter33.html#ch33"><span class="blue">33</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Utilize VR experts, subject-matter experts, usability experts, experiment-design experts, and statisticians to ensure you are doing the right things to maximize learning.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_465"></a>&#8226; Lean toward fast feedback, data collection, and experimentation. This enables the team to learn quickly how well or not ideas meet goals, and to correct course immediately.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Communication and Attitude (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.1"><span class="blue">33.1</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Seek criticism as if the success of the project and your career depends on it. Because it does!</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Have a positive attitude toward constructive criticism.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Think positively for yourself, team members, and users.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider failure to be a learning experience and do not fear it.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not blame/belittle users or their opinions/interactions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Actively investigate difficulties to determine how the project can improve.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Assume what others are doing is partially correct and then provide suggestions that enable them to correct and move on.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When someone points out a problem you are already aware of, thank them for noticing and encourage them to continue looking for problems.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>VR Creators Are Unique Users (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.1.1"><span class="blue">33.1.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not assume what works for you will work for everyone else. You likely won&#8217;t try all cases and have grown immune to motion sickness.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Programmers should at least occasionally participate in data collection so that they take feedback more seriously.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Research Concepts (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.2"><span class="blue">33.2</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Data Collection (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.2.1"><span class="blue">33.2.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not get stuck in collecting a single type of data. There are many measures that can be used.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; First collect qualitative data to get a high-level understanding before collecting more objective quantitative data.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Reliability (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.2.2"><span class="blue">33.2.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Never depend on a single measurement.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Measure across different participants, sessions, times, and experiments to gain confidence that there is some consistent characteristic for that which is being studied.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_466"></a>&#8226; Remember the true score can never be exactly known, although a large number of measurements can provide a good estimate.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Validity (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.2.3"><span class="blue">33.2.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make sure you are measuring and comparing what you think you are measuring and comparing.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Ideally, a measure should cover all aspects of the construct; correlate with other measures of the same construct; not be affected by variables not related to the construct; and accurately predict other measurement, behavior, and performance.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; A violation of construct validity has occurred when a system artifact has been measured when that is not the intention of the measurement.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not conclude a concept is not effective in general just because it does not work in its current implementation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Reduce the chance of coming to incorrect conclusions by carefully considering threats to internal validity. For example, randomize assignment of conditions, keep the setup the same across data collection sessions, remove practice effects, remove any cues that enable participants to guess the hypothesis, and make the experimenter blind to experimental conditions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be aware of threats to statistical conclusion validity to reduce the chances of making erroneous conclusions. For example, a statistical result may have happened by chance, not finding a result does not mean a result does not exist, assumptions of data may not be valid, and data mining increases the odds of finding something by chance.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not assume a finding holds across different settings, other users, other times, and other designs/implementations.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Collect data again after hardware has changed or significant design changes have occurred.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Sensitivity (Section <a href="chapter32.html#lev32.2.4"><span class="blue">32.2.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Increase the sensitivity to that which is being tested in order to increase the chance of finding an effect if it exists.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Constructivist Approaches (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3"><span class="blue">33.3</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Mini-Retrospectives (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.1"><span class="blue">33.3.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Conduct mini-retrospectives&#8212;short team discussions of what is going well and what needs improvement.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_467"></a>&#8226; It is better to have many short and consistent mini-retrospectives than occasional long retrospectives.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Respect all team members and never make a retrospective a witch hunt.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on creating themes for future iterations and areas to track that the team wants to improve upon.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Demos (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.2"><span class="blue">33.3.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Distinguish the difference between collecting user data (where the primary goal is to learn) and giving demos (where the primary goal is to market). Do not rely solely on demos for receiving feedback.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Interviews (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.3"><span class="blue">33.3.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; An interview results in the best data when given immediately after the person being interviewed experienced the VR application.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Create interview guidelines in advance in order to keep the interview on track and to reduce bias.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Attempt to match the interviewer with the intended audience based on previously created personas.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Conduct interviews in comfortable and natural settings (e.g., a mock living room).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Don&#8217;t spend more than 30 minute per interview. Set time limits by scheduling interviews back to back. Individuals can be followed up with if they have more useful things to say.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Questionnaires (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.4"><span class="blue">33.3.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use questionnaires when ease of administration and privacy are important.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Ask for background information to determine if participants fit the target population defined by previously created personas, to help better define personas, to make sure a breadth of users is providing feedback, to match participants when comparing between participants, and to look for correlations with performance.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Focus Groups (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.5"><span class="blue">33.3.5</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use focus groups in the early phases of VR design to explore new concepts, better refine questions, and improve upon data collection processes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Group settings are often more efficient than individual interviews and can stimulate thinking as participants build off of each other&#8217;s ideas.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page_468"></a><strong>Expert Evaluations (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.6"><span class="blue">33.3.6</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When done properly, expert evaluations are the most efficient and cost-effective method of improving upon the usability of a system and for iterating toward ideal solutions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Start early in the project with expert guidelines-based evaluations in order to correct issues before they affect other aspects of the design.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Conduct formative usability evaluations during the formative and evolving stages of design in order to assess, refine, and improve usability, learning, performance, and exploration.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Formative usability evaluation should be conducted by VR usability experts as it relies heavily on a solid understanding of VR interactions that vary depending on context (i.e., it consists of more than a predefined list of items to evaluate).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Pay special attention to critical incidents and make it the highest priority to fix issues causing these incidents.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Design a scoring system apparent to users in order to both increase motivation and target data collection.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; During the final stages of formative usability evaluation, only observe and do not suggest how to interact with the system.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use comparative evaluation to compare two or more well-formed complete or near-complete implementations. This is useful for choosing the best techniques for final integration and to test if a new system is better than a previous system (e.g., Does the new VR training system result in more productivity than traditional training?).</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>After Action Reviews (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.3.7"><span class="blue">33.3.7</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Debrief users with an emphasis on the specific actions they took during the VR experience.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Discuss what happened, why it happened, and how it could be done better.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Discuss with the user the actions she was taking while watching a recording from both first-person and third-person views.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>The Scientific Method (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.4"><span class="blue">33.4</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Even if you do not conduct formal experiments, learn the basics in order to design more informal experiments, to comprehend research conducted by others, <a id="page_469"></a>to be aware of some of the pitfalls that might occur in collecting data, and to properly interpret results.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The first step of exploring a problem is to obtain an understanding of what is to be studied. Do this by learning from others (via trying their applications, reading research reports/papers, and talking with them); by trying oneself and observing others interacting with existing VR applications; by constructivist approaches; and by the various concepts discussed in the Define and Make Stages.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Once familiar with the overall problem, start by asking and answering high-level questions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Precisely state the hypothesis in a way that predicts the relationship between two variables.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be careful of confounding factors. Consider threats to internal validity to find confounding factors. Once found, set confounds to be constant with control variables.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use a within subjects design when only a small number of participants are available and carryover effects (e.g., learning, fatigue, sickness) are minimal and/or participants can be counterbalanced.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use a between subjects design when many participants are available, their availability is short, and carryover effects are a concern.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Always conduct informal pilot studies before conducting a more formal and rigorous experiment in order to help determine feasibility; discover unexpected challenges; improve upon the experiment design; reduce time and cost; and estimate statistical power, effect size, and sample size.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When random assignment is difficult, consider quasi-experiments instead of true experiments at the risk of adding confounding factors.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong>Data Analysis (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.5"><span class="blue">33.5</span></a>)</strong></h4>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Making Sense of the Data (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.5.1"><span class="blue">33.5.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When first looking at data, start by looking for patterns but be careful of assuming a pattern is the truth as fishing for data can lead to false conclusions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Pay attention to outliers as an outlier can provide more insight than more typical data. Often an outlier is an important signal telling you to fix an error.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The result of a single experiment is rarely the generalized truth. Do not base final decisions on a single experiment and consider how changes may affect results.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><a id="page_470"></a><strong>Statistical Concepts (Section <a href="chapter33.html#lev33.5.2"><span class="blue">33.5.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; All team members should be familiar with basic statistical concepts so a common language is spoken, wrong assumptions and errors can be reduced, and research from others can be understood.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; At least one member of the team should be good at statistical analysis.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Pay attention to measurement types and only perform appropriate calculations on each. For example, do not perform multiplication on interval data and do not add ordinal data.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For averages, use the median when data is skewed to not take into account outliers or when data is ordinal. Use the mode when data is categorical.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Visualize data with histograms to intuitively understand the spread of data.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Understand the differences of statistical significance and practical significance. Statistical significance is not necessarily meaningful.</p>
