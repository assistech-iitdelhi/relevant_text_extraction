<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Perceptual Models and Processes</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The human brain is quite complex and cannot be described by a single model or process. This chapter discusses some models and processes that provide different perspectives about how the mind works. Note these concepts are not necessarily absolute &#8220;truths&#8221; but are simplified models that provide useful ways to think about perception. These concepts help explain various factors that affect human perception and behavior; enable us to create virtual environments that better communicate with a diverse set of users; help us to better program interaction into our environments to better respond to users on their terms; and help us induce more engaging and fulfilling experiences into the minds of users.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.1"></a><strong><span class="font">7.1</span> Distal and Proximal Stimuli</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">To understand perception, we must first understand the difference between the concepts of distal (distant) stimuli and proximal (approximate = close) stimuli.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Distal stimuli</strong> are actual objects and events out in the world (objective reality).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Proximal stimuli</strong> are the energy from distal stimuli that actually reach the senses (eyes, ears, skin, etc.).</p>
<p class="indentt">The primary task of perception is to interpret distal stimuli in the world in order to guide effective survival-producing, goal-driven behaviors. One challenge is that a proximal stimulus is not always an ideal source of information about the distal stimulus. For example, light rays from distal objects form an image on the retina in the back of the eye. But this image continually changes as lighting varies, we move through the world, our eyes rotate, etc. Although this proximal image is what triggers the neural signals to the brain, we are often quite unaware of the overall image or pay little attention to it (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.1"><span class="blue">10.1</span></a>). Instead, we are aware of and respond to the distal objects that the proximal stimulus represents.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_72"></a>Factors that play a role in characterizing distal stimuli include context, prior knowledge, expectations, and other sensory input. Perceptual psychologists seek to understand how the brain extracts accurate stable perceptions of objects and events from limited and inadequate information.</p>
<p class="indent">Our job as VR creators is to create an artificial distal virtual world and then project that distal world onto the senses; the better we can do this in a way that the body and brain expects then the more users will feel present in the virtual world.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.2"></a><strong><span class="font">7.2</span> Sensation vs. Perception</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Sensations</strong> are elementary processes that enable low-level recognition of distal stimuli through proximal stimuli. For example, in vision, sensation occurs as photons fall on the retina. In hearing, sensation occurs as waves of pulsating air are collected by the outer ear and are transmitted through the bones of the middle/inner ear to the cochlea.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Perception</strong> is a higher-level process that combines information from the senses and filters, organizes, and interprets those sensations to give meaning and to create subjective, conscious experiences. This gives us awareness of the world around us. Two <a id="pg72lev1"></a>people can receive the same sensory information yet perceive two different things. Moreover, even the same person can perceive the same stimulus differently (e.g., ambiguous figures as shown in Figure <a href="chapter06.html#fig6.1"><span class="blue">6.1</span></a> or emotional responses when listening to the same song at different times).</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.2.1"></a><strong><span class="font1">7.2.1</span> Binding</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Sensations of shapes, colors, motion, audio, proprioception, vestibular cues, and touch all cause independent firing of neurons in different parts of the cortex. <strong>Binding</strong> is the process by which stimuli are combined to create our conscious perception of a coherent object&#8212;a &#8220;red ball,&#8221; for example [<a href="reference.html#ref100"><span class="blue">Goldstein 2014</span></a>]. We have integrated perceptions of objects, with all the object&#8217;s features bound together to create a single coherent perception of the object. Binding is also important to perceive multimodal events as coming from a single entity. However, sometimes we incorrectly assign features of one object to another object. An example is the ventriloquism effect that causes people to believe a sound comes from a source when it is actually coming from somewhere else (Section <a href="chapter08.html#lev8.7"><span class="blue">8.7</span></a>). These illusory conjunctions most typically occur when some event happens quickly (such as errors in eyewitness testimony of a crime), or the scene is only briefly presented to the observer. Maintaining spatial and temporal compliance (Section <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.2.5"><span class="blue">25.2.5</span></a>) across sensory modalities increases binding and is <a id="page_73"></a>especially important for maximizing intuitive VR interactions as well as minimizing motion sickness (Section <a href="chapter12.html#lev12.3.1"><span class="blue">12.3.1</span></a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.3"></a><strong><span class="font">7.3</span> Bottom-Up and Top-Down Processing</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Bottom-up processing</strong> (also called data-based processing) is processing that is based on proximal stimuli [<a href="reference.html#ref100"><span class="blue">Goldstein 2014</span></a>] that provides the starting point for perception. Tracking the perceptual process from sensory stimulation to transduction to neural processing is an example of bottom-up processing. VR uses bottom-up stimuli (e.g., pixels on the display) that is sufficiently convincing (i.e., to create presence) to overcome top-down data that suggests we are just wearing an HMD.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Top-down processing</strong> (also called knowledge-based or conceptually based processing) refers to processing that is based on knowledge&#8212;that is, the influence of an observer&#8217;s experiences and expectations on what he perceives. At any given time, an observer has a mental model (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a>) of the world. For example, we know through experience that object properties tend to be constant (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.1"><span class="blue">10.1</span></a>). Conversely, we modify what we expect based on situational properties or changeable aspects of the environment. The perception of a distal stimulus is heavily biased toward this internal model [<a href="reference.html#ref98"><span class="blue">Goldstein 2007</span></a>, <a href="reference.html#ref105"><span class="blue">Gregory 1973</span></a>]. <a id="pg73lev1"></a>As stimuli become more complex, the role of top-down processing increases. Our knowledge of how things are in the world plays an important role in determining what we perceive. As VR creators, we take advantage of top-down processing (e.g., the user&#8217;s experience from the real or virtual world) that enables us to create interesting content and more engaging stories.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.4"></a><strong><span class="font">7.4</span> Afference and Efference</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Afferent nerve</strong> impulses travel from sensory receptors inward toward the central nervous system. <strong>Efferent nerve</strong> impulses travel from the central nervous system outward toward effectors such as muscles. <strong>Efference copy</strong> sends a signal equal to the efference to an area of the brain that predicts afference. This prediction allows the central nervous system to initiate responses before sensory feedback occurs. The brain compares the efference copy with the incoming afferent signals. If the signals match, then this suggests the afference is solely due to the observer&#8217;s actions. This is known as <strong>re-afference</strong>, since the afference reconfirms that the intended action has taken place. If the efference copy and afference do not match, then the observer perceives the stimulus to have occurred from a change in the external world (passive motion) instead of from the self (active motion).</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_74"></a><a id="fig7.1"></a><img src="../images/f0074-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 7.1</span> Efference copy during rotation of the eye.</strong> (Based on <a href="reference.html#ref256"><span class="blue">Razzaque</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref256"><span class="blue">2005</span></a>], adapted from <a href="reference.html#ref105"><span class="blue">Gregory</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref105"><span class="blue">1973</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indent">Afference and efference copy result in the world being perceived differently depending upon whether the stimulus is applied actively or passively [<a href="reference.html#ref105"><span class="blue">Gregory 1973</span></a>]. For example, when eye muscles move the eyeball (efference), efference copy matches <a id="pg74lev1"></a>the expected image motion on the retina (re-afference), resulting in the perception of a visually stable world (Figure <a href="chapter07.html#fig7.1"><span class="blue">7.1</span></a>). However, if an external force moves the eyeball the world seems to visually move. This can be demonstrated by closing one eye and gently pushing the skin covering the open eye near the temple. The finger forcing the movement of the eye is considered to be passive with respect to the way the brain normally controls eye movement. The perceived visual shifting of the scene is due to the brain receiving no efference copy from the brain&#8217;s command to move the eye muscles. The afference (the movement of the scene on the retina) is then greater than the zero efference copy, so the external world is perceived to move.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.5"></a><strong><span class="font">7.5</span> Iterative Perceptual Processing</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In a simplified form, perception can be considered an ever-evolving sequence of processing steps, as shown in Figure <a href="chapter07.html#fig7.2"><span class="blue">7.2</span></a>.</p>
<p class="indent">At a high level, the three steps of Goldstein&#8217;s <strong>iterative perceptual process</strong> [<a href="reference.html#ref98"><span class="blue">Goldstein 2007</span></a>] are</p>
<p class="indentnumbert">1. stimulus to physiology&#8212;the external world falling onto our sensory receptors;</p>
<p class="indentnumber">2. physiology to perception&#8212;our perceptual interpretation of those signals; and</p>
<p class="indentnumber">3. perception to stimulus&#8212;our behavioral actions that influence the external world, resulting in an endless cycle that we call life.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_75"></a><a id="fig7.2"></a><img src="../images/f0075-01.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><a id="pg75lev1"></a><strong><span class="blue">Figure 7.2</span> Perception is a continual process that is dynamic and continually changing. Purple arrows represent stimuli, blue arrows represent sensation, and orange arrows represent perception.</strong> (Adapted from <a href="reference.html#ref98"><span class="blue">Goldstein</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref98"><span class="blue">2007</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indentt">These stages can be broken down further. As we journey through a world, we are confronted with a complex physical world (distal stimuli). Because there is far too much happening in the word, we scan the scene, looking at, listening to, or feeling things that catch our interest (attended stimuli). Photons, vibrations, and pressure falls onto our body (proximal stimuli). Our organs that sense such physical properties are transformed into electrochemical signals (transduction). These signals then go through complex neurological interactions (processing) that are influenced by our past experiences (top-down knowledge). This results in our conscious sensory experience (perception). We then are able to categorize or give meaning to those perceptions (recognition). This determines our behavior (action), which in turn affects distal stimuli, and the process continues.</p>
<p class="indent">For VR, we hijack real-world distal stimuli and replace those stimuli with computer-generated distal stimuli as a function of geometric models and algorithms. If we could <a id="page_76"></a>somehow perfectly replicate the real world with our models and algorithms, then VR would be indistinguishable from reality.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.6"></a><strong><span class="font">7.6</span> The Subconscious and Conscious</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The human mind can be thought as two different components&#8212;the subconscious and the conscious. Table <span class="blue">7.1</span> summarizes characteristics of the two [<a href="reference.html#ref230"><span class="blue">Norman 2013</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">The <strong>subconscious</strong> is everything that occurs within our mind that we are not fully aware of but very much influences our emotions and behaviors. Because subconscious processing happens in parallel and without our awareness, the processing seems to occur naturally and automatically without effort. The subconscious is very much a pattern finder, generalizing incoming stimuli into the context of the past. Whereas the subconscious is powerful, it can also heavily bias us toward decisions based on false trends that cause us to behave inappropriately. The subconscious also is limited in the sense that it cannot arrange symbols in an intelligent fashion or make specific plans more than a couple of steps into the future.</p>
<p class="indent">When something comes into our awareness, it becomes part of our conscious. <a id="pg76lev1"></a>The <strong>conscious</strong> is the mind&#8217;s totality of sensations, perceptions, ideas, attitudes, and feelings that we are aware of at any given time. The conscious is good at considering, pondering, analyzing, comparing, explaining, and rationalizing. However, the mind is slow as it primarily processes in a sequential manner and can become overwhelmed, resulting in analysis paralysis. The written word, mathematics, and programming are very much tools of the conscious.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the subconscious and conscious are each subject to mistakes, misunderstandings, and suboptimal solutions, the strengths of each can help balance disadvantages of the other. The integration of the two parts together often creates insight and innovation that would otherwise not be realized.</p>

<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_77"></a><a id="lev7.7"></a><strong><span class="font">7.7</span> Visceral, Behavioral, Reflective, and Emotional Processes</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">A useful approximate model of human cognition and reaction can be categorized into four levels of processing: visceral, behavioral, reflective, and emotional [<a href="reference.html#ref230"><span class="blue">Norman 2013</span></a>]. All four can be thought of as different forms of pattern recognition and prediction, and work together to determine a person&#8217;s state. High-level cognitive reflection and emotion can trigger low-level visceral and physiological responses. Conversely, low-level visceral responses can trigger high-level reflective thinking.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.7.1"></a><strong><span class="font1">7.7.1</span> Visceral Processing</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Visceral processes,</strong> often referred to as &#8220;the lizard brain,&#8221; are tightly coupled with the motor system, serving as reflexive and protective mechanisms to help with immediate survival. Visceral communication (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2.1"><span class="blue">1.2.1</span></a>) results in immediate reaction and judgments such as a situation or person being dangerous. Visceral reactions are immediate; there is no time to determine cause, or to blame, or even to feel emotions. Visceral responses are precursors to many emotions and can also be caused by emotions. Although high-level learning does not occur through visceral processes, sensitization and desensitization can occur through sensory adaptation (Section <a href="chapter10.html#lev10.2"><span class="blue">10.2</span></a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Examples of visceral reactions include the startle reflex resulting from unexpected <a id="pg77lev1"></a>events, fight-or-flight responses, fear of heights, and the childhood anxiety produced by the lights being shut off. The visceral response to fear of heights is especially popular for demonstrating the power of VR (e.g., viewing the world from the top edge of a tall building).</p>
<p class="indent">Visceral processes are the initial reaction that is all about attraction or repulsion and have little to do with how usable, effective, or understandable a product or VR experience is. Many of us who consider ourselves &#8220;smart&#8221; tend to dismiss visceral responses as irrelevant and have trouble understanding the importance of an experience &#8220;feeling better.&#8221; Great designers use their aesthetic intuition to drive visceral responses that result in positive states and high affection from users.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.7.2"></a><strong><span class="font1">7.7.2</span> Behavioral Processing</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Behavioral processes</strong> are learned skills and intuitive interactions triggered by situations that match stored neural patterns, and are largely subconscious. Even though we are usually aware of our actions, we are often unaware of the details.</p>
<p class="indent">When we consciously act, all we have to do is think of the goal; then the body and mind handle most of the details with little awareness of those details. An example is when one picks up an object, the person first wills the action and then it happens&#8212;there is no need to consciously orient and position the hand. If a VR user wishes to grab an object in the world, she simply thinks of grabbing an object, the hand moves <a id="page_78"></a>toward the object to intersect it, then pushes a button to pick it up (assuming she has learned how to use a tracked controller).</p>
<p class="indent">The desire to control the environment gives motivation to learning new behaviors. When control cannot be obtained or things do not go as planned, then frustration and anger often results. This is especially true when new useful behaviors cannot be learned due to not understanding the reasons why something doesn&#8217;t work. Feedback (Section <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.2.4"><span class="blue">25.2.4</span></a>) is critical to learning new interfaces, even if that feedback is negative, and VR applications should always provide some form of feedback.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.7.3"></a><strong><span class="font1">7.7.3</span> Reflective Processing</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Reflective processing</strong> ranges from basic conscious thinking to examining one&#8217;s own thoughts and feelings. Higher-level reflection gives understanding and enables one to make logical decisions. Reflective processing is much slower than visceral and behavioral processing; reflective processing typically occurs after an event has happened. Indirect communication (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2.2"><span class="blue">1.2.2</span></a>) such as spoken language or internal thoughts (i.e., speaking to oneself) is the tool of reflective processing. In contrast to visceral processing, reflective processing evaluates circumstances, assigns cause, and places blame.</p>
<p class="indent">Reflective processing is where we create stories within our minds (that might be far from what actually happened). Reflective stories and memories are often more important than what previously actually happened because the past no longer exists&#8212;what is more important is to predict and plan into the future based off the stories that we created. Reflective stories create the highest levels of emotion&#8212;highs and lows of remembered or anticipated events. Emotion and cognition are much more tightly intertwined than most people believe.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.7.4"></a><strong><span class="font1">7.7.4</span> Emotional Processing</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Emotional processing</strong> is the affective aspect of consciousness that powerfully processes data, resulting in physiological and psychological visceral and behavioral responses. This is done in a way that requires less effort and occurs faster than more reflective thinking&#8212;providing intuitive insight to assess a situation or whether a goal is desirable or not.</p>
<p class="indent">If a person did not have emotions, then making decisions would be difficult as emotion assigns subjective value and judgments, whereas rational thinking assigns more objective understanding. Emotions are also more easily recalled than objective facts that are not associated with emotions. Logic is often used to backward-rationalize a decision that has already been made emotionally. Once a person has made an emotional decision, then some significant event or insight must occur for them to change <a id="page_79"></a>that decision. People use emotion to pursue rational thought, such as being motivated to pursue the study of mathematics, art, or VR. Emotions can also be detrimental because they evolved in order to maximize immediate survival and reproduction rather than to achieve longer-term goals that empower us to move beyond just survival.</p>
<p class="indent">The emotional connection at the end of a VR experience is often what is remembered, so if the end experience is good the memories may be positive&#8212;but only if the user can make it that far. Conversely, one bad initial exposure can be so bad that they may never want to experience that application again, or in the worst case never want to experience any VR again.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.8"></a><strong><span class="font">7.8</span> Mental Models</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">A <strong>mental model</strong> is a simplified explanation in the mind of how the world or some specific aspect of the world works. The primary purpose of a mental model is prediction, and the best model is the simplest one that enables one to predict how a situation will turn out well enough to take appropriate action.</p>
<p class="indent">An analogy of a mental model is a physical map of the real world. The map is not the territory&#8212;meaning we form subjective representations (or maps) of objective reality <a id="pg79lev1"></a>(the territory), but the representation is not actually the reality, just as a map of a place is not actually the place itself but a more or less accurate representation [<a href="reference.html#ref166"><span class="blue">Korzybski 1933</span></a>]. Most people confuse their maps of reality with reality itself. A person&#8217;s interpretation/model created in the mind (the map) is not the truth (the territory), although it might be a simplified version of the truth. The value of a model is in the result that can be produced (e.g., an entertaining experience or learning new skills).</p>
<p class="indent">We all create mental models of ourselves, others, the environment, and objects we interact with. Different people often have different mental models of the same thing as these models are created through top-down processes that are derived from previous experience, training, and instruction that may not be consistent. In fact, an individual might have multiple models of the same thing, with each model dealing with a different aspect of its operation [<a href="reference.html#ref230"><span class="blue">Norman 2013</span></a>]. These models might even be in conflict with each other.</p>
<p class="indent">A good mental model need not be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful. Ideally, complexity should be able to be intuitively understood with the simplest mental model possible that can achieve the desired results, but not simpler. An oversimplified model can be dangerous when implicit assumptions are not valid, in which case the model might be erroneous and therefore result in difficulties. Useful models serve as guides to help with understanding of a world, predict how objects in that world will behave, and interact with the world in order to achieve goals. Without <a id="page_80"></a>such a mental model, we would fumble around mindlessly without the intelligence of fully appreciating why something works and what to expect from our actions. We could manage by following directions precisely, but when problems occur or an unexpected situation arises, then a good mental model is essential. VR creators should use signifying cues, feedback, and constraints (Section <a href="chapter25.html#lev25.1"><span class="blue">25.1</span></a>) to help the user form quality mental models and to make assumptions explicit.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Learned helplessness</strong> is the decision that something cannot be done, at least by the person making the decision, resulting in giving up due to a perceived absence of control. It has been difficult for VR to gain wide adoption, and this can be compounded by poor interfaces. Bad interaction design for even a single task can quickly lead to learned helplessness&#8212;a couple of failures not only can erode confidence for the specific task but can generalize to the belief that interacting in VR is difficult. If users don&#8217;t get feedback of at least a sign of minimal success, then they may get bored, not realizing they could do more, and mentally or physically eject themselves from the experience.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev7.9"></a><strong><span class="font">7.9</span> Neuro-Linguistic Programming</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Neuro-linguistic programming</strong> (NLP) is a psychological approach to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy that is built on the concept of mental models (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a>). NLP itself is a model that explains how humans process stimuli that enter into the mind through the senses, and helps to explain how we perceive, communicate, learn, and behave. Its creators, Richard Bandler and John Grinder, claim NLP connects neurological processes (&#8220;neuro&#8221;) to language (&#8220;linguistic&#8221;) and our behaviors are the results of psychological &#8220;programs&#8221; built by experiences. Furthermore, they claim that skills of experts can be acquired by modeling the neuro-linguistic patterns of those experts. NLP is quite controversial and some of the claims/details are disputed. However, even if some of the specific details of NLP do not describe neurological processes accurately, some NLP high-level concepts are useful in thinking about how users interpret stimuli presented to them by a VR application.</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone perceives and acts in their own unique way, even when they are in the same situation. This is because humans manipulate pure sensory information depending upon their &#8220;program.&#8221; Each individual&#8217;s program is determined by the sum of one&#8217;s entire life experiences, so each program is unique. With this being said, there are patterns to programs and we can make different people&#8217;s experiences of an event more consistent if we understand the mind&#8217;s programs. In the case of VR, we can control what stimuli are presented to users and influence, not control, what that person <a id="page_81"></a>experiences. Understanding how sensory cues are integrated into the mind and precisely controlling stimuli enables us to more directly and consistently communicate and influence users&#8217; experiences. This understanding also helps us to change what is presented to users based on users&#8217; behaviors and personal preferences.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.9.1"></a><span class="font1">7.9.1</span> The NLP Communication Model</h4>
<p class="noindent">The NLP communication model describes how external stimuli affect our internal state and behavior. As shown in Figure <a href="chapter07.html#fig7.3"><span class="blue">7.3</span></a>, the NLP communication model [<a href="reference.html#ref142"><span class="blue">James and Woodsmall 1988</span></a>] can be divided into three components: external stimuli, filters, and internal state. External stimuli enter through our senses and then are filtered in various ways before integrating with our internal state. The person then subconsciously and consciously behaves in some way that potentially modifies external stimuli, creating a continuously repeating communication cycle.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="fig7.3"></a><img src="../images/f0081-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 7.3</span> The NLP communication model states that external events are filtered as they enter into the mind, and then result in an individual&#8217;s specific behavior.</strong> (Adapted from <a id="pg81lev1"></a><a href="reference.html#ref142"><span class="blue">James and Woodsmall</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref142"><span class="blue">1988</span></a>])</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="page_82"></a><strong><a id="lev7.9.2"></a><span class="font1">7.9.2</span> External Stimuli</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">NLP asserts that humans perceive events and external stimuli through the sensory input channels. Furthermore, individuals have a dominant or preferred sensory modality. Not only do individuals perceive their preferred modality better but their primary method of thinking is in terms of that preferred modality. So a visual person thinks more with pictures than an auditory person, who thinks more with sounds. Even when external stimuli are in one form, they are often perceived partially in the preferred modality. For example, visually dominant individuals will react more to visual words that convey color or form. These concepts of preferred modalities are especially important for education as students learn in different ways. By providing sensory cues across all modalities, individuals are more likely to comprehend the concept being presented. For example, kinesthetic-oriented students learn best by doing rather than by watching or listening. One trap VR creators often fall into is that they focus on their preferred modality, when many users of their system may have a different preferred modality. VR creators should present sensory cues across all modalities to cover a wider range of users.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><a id="lev7.9.3"></a><span class="font1">7.9.3</span> Filters</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pg82lev1"></a>A vast majority of sensory information that we absorb is assimilated by our minds subconsciously. While our subconscious minds are able to absorb and store a large portion of what is happening around us, our conscious minds can only handle about 7 &#177; 2 &#8220;chunks&#8221; [<a href="reference.html#ref54"><span class="blue">Csikszentmihalyi 2008</span></a>]. In addition, our minds interpret incoming data in different ways depending on the context and our past experiences in order to comprehend, discern, and utilize the complexity of the world. If our minds objectively accepted all information, then our lives would immediately become overwhelmed and we would not be able to sustain our individual selves or society as a whole. These processes can be thought of as perceptual filters that do three things: delete, distort, and generalize.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Deletion</strong> omits certain aspects of incoming sensory information by selectively paying attention to only parts of the world. For specific moments of time, we focus on what is most important and the rest is deleted from our conscious awareness in order to prevent becoming overwhelmed with information.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Distortion</strong> modifies incoming sensory information, enabling us to take into account the context of the environment and previous experiences. This is often beneficial but can be deceiving when something that happens in the world does not match one&#8217;s mental model of the world. Being intimidated by technology, frightened of situations that we logically know are not real, or misinterpreting <a id="page_83"></a>what occurred in a simulation are examples of how we distort incoming information. Categories of distortion include polarization (thinking of things in absolute extremes; e.g., the enemy in a game (or war) is wholly evil), mind reading (e.g., that avatar doesn&#8217;t like me), and catastrophizing (e.g., I&#8217;m going to die if the goblin hits me).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Generalization</strong> is the process of drawing global conclusions based off of one or more experiences. A majority of the time generalization is beneficial. For example, a user that works through a tutorial that teaches how to open a door for the first time quickly generalizes their new ability so that all types of doors can be opened from then on. Designing VR experiences that are consistent will, over time, cause users to form filters that generalize perception of events and interactions. Generalization can also cause problems such as occurs with learned helplessness (Section <a href="chapter07.html#lev7.8"><span class="blue">7.8</span></a>). For example, a user might generalize that memorizing VR controls is difficult after a couple of failed attempts.</p>
<p class="indentt">The filters that delete, distort, and generalize vary from deeply unconscious processes to more conscious processes. Different people perceive things in different ways even when sensing the same thing. Listed below are descriptions of these filters in approximate order of increasing awareness.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Meta programs</strong> are the most unconscious filters and are content-free applying to all situations. Some consider meta programs to be one&#8217;s &#8220;hardware&#8221; that individuals are born with and are difficult to change. Meta programs are similar to personality types. An example of a meta program is &#8220;optimism&#8221; where a person is generally optimistic regardless of the situation.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Values</strong> are filters that automatically judge if things are good or bad, or right or wrong. Ironically, values are context specific; therefore, what&#8217;s important in one area of a person&#8217;s life may not be important in other areas of his life. A player of a video game may value game characters very differently than how that person values real living people.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Beliefs</strong> are convictions about what is true or real in and about the world. Deep beliefs are assumptions that are not consciously realized. Weaker beliefs can be modified when brought to conscious thought and questioned by others. Beliefs can very much empower or hinder performance in VR (e.g., the belief &#8220;I&#8217;m not smart enough&#8221; can dramatically reduce performance).</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Attitudes</strong> are values and belief systems about specific subjects. Attitudes are sometimes conscious and sometimes subconscious. An example of an attitude is &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this part of the training.&#8221;</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_84"></a><strong>Memories</strong> are past experiences that are reenacted consciously in the present moment. Individual and collective experiences influence current perceptions and behaviors. Designers can take advantage of memories by providing cues in the environment that remind users of some past event.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Decisions</strong> are conclusions or resolutions reached after reflection and consideration. Past decisions affect present decisions and people tend to stick with a decision once it is made. Past decisions are what create values, beliefs, and attitudes, and therefore influence how we make current decisions and respond to current situations. A person who decided they liked a first VR experience will certainly be more open to new VR experiences, whereas someone who had an initial bad VR experience will be more difficult to convince VR is the future, even with higher-quality subsequent experiences. Make sure users have a positive experience from the beginning of each session so that they are more likely to decide they like what they experience overall.</p>
<p class="indentt">Although VR creators don&#8217;t have control over users&#8217; filters, learning about the target user&#8217;s general values, beliefs, attitudes, and memories can help in creating a VR experience. Section <a href="chapter31.html#lev31.10"><span class="blue">31.10</span></a> discusses how to create personas to better target a VR application to users&#8217; wants and needs.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a id="lev7.9.4"></a><strong><span class="font1">7.9.4</span> Internal State</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">As incoming information passes through our filters, thoughts are constructed in the form of a mental model called an internal representation. This internal representation takes the form of sensory perceptions (e.g., a visual scene with sounds, tastes, and smells) that may or may not exist as external stimuli. This model triggers and is triggered by emotional states, which in turn changes one&#8217;s physiology and motivates behavior. Although internal representation and emotional state cannot be directly measured, physiological state and behavior can.</p>
