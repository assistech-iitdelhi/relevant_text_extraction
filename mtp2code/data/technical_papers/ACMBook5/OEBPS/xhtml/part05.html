<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>INTERACTION</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent">For this book, interaction is defined to be a subset of general communication (Section <a href="chapter01.html#lev1.2"><span class="blue">1.2</span></a>). <strong>Interaction</strong> is the communication that occurs between a user and the VR application that is mediated through the use of input and output devices. An <strong>interface</strong> is the VR system side of the interaction that exists whether a user is interacting or not.</p>
<p class="indent">Interaction in VR at first seems obvious&#8212;simply interact with the virtual world in a similar way that we interact with the real world. Unfortunately, natural real-world interfaces (and Hollywood interfaces) often do not work well within VR as one would expect. This is not only because virtual worlds do not model the real world as closely as we would like, but even if they did, abstract interfaces are often superior (e.g., if one wanted to look up information in a virtual world, one would not want to have to travel to a virtual library to find a virtual book). Whereas some of the basic concepts from traditional desktop interfaces can be used within immersive environments, there are few similarities between the two. Creating quality interactions is currently one of the greatest challenges for VR.</p>
<p class="indent">Well-implemented interaction techniques enable high levels of performance and comfort while diminishing the impact of human and hardware limitations. It is the role of the interaction designer to make complex interactions intuitive and effective.</p>
<p class="indentt"><strong>Part <a href="part05.html#part5"><span class="blue">V</span></a></strong> consists of five chapters that provide an overview of the most important aspects of VR interaction design.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter25.html#ch25"><span class="blue">25</span></a>, Human-Centered Interaction,</strong> reviews core concepts for general human-centered interaction: intuitiveness, Norman&#8217;s principles of interaction design, direct vs. indirect interaction, the cycle of interaction, and the human hands.</p>
<p class="hanga"><a id="page_276"></a><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter26.html#ch26"><span class="blue">26</span></a>, VR Interaction,</strong> discusses some of the most important distinctions especially relevant to VR interaction, such as interaction fidelity, proprioceptive and egocentric interaction, reference frames, multimodal interaction, and unique challenges of VR interaction.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter27.html#ch27"><span class="blue">27</span></a>, Input Devices,</strong> provides an overview of input device characteristics and classes of various input devices. No single input device is appropriate for all VR applications, and choosing the most appropriate input device for the intended experience is essential for optimizing interactions.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter28.html#ch28"><span class="blue">28</span></a>, Interaction Patterns and Techniques,</strong> describes several interaction patterns and examples of various interaction techniques. An interaction pattern is a generalized high-level interaction concept that can be used over and over again across different applications to achieve common user goals. An interaction technique is a more specific implementation of an interaction pattern.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter29.html#ch29"><span class="blue">29</span></a>, Interaction: Design Guidelines,</strong> summarizes the previous four chapters and lists a number of actionable guidelines for developing interaction techniques that largely depend on application needs.</p>
