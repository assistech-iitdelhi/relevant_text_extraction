<p class="noindent3"><a id="page_viii"></a><a id="page_ix"></a><strong>This book is dedicated to</strong> the entire community of VR researchers, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, managers, marketers, and users. It is their passion for, and contributions to, VR that makes this all possible. Without this community, working in isolation would make VR an interesting niche research project that could neither be shared nor improved upon by others. If you choose to join this community, your pursuit of VR experiences may very well be the most intense years of your life, but you will find the rewards well worth the effort. Perhaps the greatest rewards will come from the users of your experiences&#8212;for if you do VR well then your users will tell you how you have changed their lives&#8212;and that is how we change the world.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many facets to VR creation, ranging from getting the technology right, sometimes during exhausting overnight sessions, to the fascinating and abundant collaboration with others in the VR community. At times, what we are embarking on can feel overwhelming. When that happens, I look to a quote by George Bernard Shaw posted on my wall and am reminded about the joy of being a part of the VR revolution.</p>
<p class="blockquotet">This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no &#8220;brief candle&#8221; to me. It is sort of a splendid torch which I have a hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it over to future generations.</p>
<p class="indentt">This book is thus dedicated to the VR community and the future generations that will create many virtual worlds as well as change the real world. My purpose in writing this book is to welcome others into this VR community, to help fuel a VR revolution that changes the world and the way we interact with it and each other, in ways that have never before been possible&#8212;until now.</p>
