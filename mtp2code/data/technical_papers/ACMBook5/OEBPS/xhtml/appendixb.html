<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Presentation.</strong> Any comments on the audio, visual, or other cues? Did anything not look, sound, or feel good?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Engagement and presence.</strong> Did they feel engaged in the virtual world? Did they feel like they were looking at/observing the experience or did they feel like they were a part of the experience? Were there any specific problems or events that broke the illusion?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Understanding and intuitiveness.</strong> Was the experience understandable? Was it obvious what they were expected to do? What specifically was difficult to understand?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Time usage.</strong> Did they want to use the system more? Or was the session too long or too tiring?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Ease of use and difficulties.</strong> Were the tasks easy or difficult to interact with? Any comments on the difficulty of using the system? What specifically could be improved upon?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Missing features and ideas.</strong> What would they have liked to experience that was not available? What would be some useful things to include in a future version?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Other comment and suggestions.</strong> Any other comments or suggestions to make the system and experience better?</p>
<p class="boxnoindentt"><strong>Thank them for participating.</strong> Ask them if they would like to participate in future events and/or provide further feedback. Collect contact information.</p>
