<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Content Creation: Design Guidelines</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Virtual worlds begin as an entirely open slate for the content designer to build upon. The preceding four chapters and the following guidelines will help to lay the foundation and paint the details of newly created worlds.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev24.1"></a><strong><span class="font">24.1</span> High-Level Concepts of Content Creation (Chapter <a href="chapter20.html#ch20"><span class="blue">20</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Experiencing the Story (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.1"><span class="blue">20.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on creating and refining a great experience that is enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on conveying the key points of the story instead of the details of everything. The users should all consistently get those essential points. For the non-essential points, their minds will fill in the gaps with their own story.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use real-world metaphors to teach users how to interact and move through the world.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To create a powerful story, focus on strong emotions, deep engagement, massive stimulation, and an escape from reality.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on the experience instead of the technology.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide a relatable background story before immersing users into the virtual world.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make the story simple and clear.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on why users are there and what there is to do.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide a specific goal to perform.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on believability instead of photorealism.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Keep the experience tame enough for the most sensitive users.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_268"></a>&#8226; Minimize breaks-in-presence.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on the targeted audience.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>The Core Experience (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.2"><span class="blue">20.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Keep the core experience the same even with an array of various contexts and constraints.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make the core experience enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding so users want to come back for more.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If the core experience is not implemented well, then no number of fancy features will keep users engaged for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Continuously improve the core experience, build various prototypes focused on that core, and learn from observing and collecting data from real users.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Conceptual Integrity (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.3"><span class="blue">20.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The core conceptual model should be consistent.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make the basic structure of the world directly evident and self-explanatory.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Eliminate extraneous content and features that are immaterial to the intended experience.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Have one good idea rather than several loosely related good ideas. If there are too many good incompatible ideas, then reconsider the primary idea to provide an overarching theme that encompasses all of the best ideas in a coherent manner.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Empower a director who controls the basic concept to lead the project.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The director defines the project, but is not a dictator of implementation or data collection.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The director should always give full credit, even when others have implemented his ideas.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; The director should be fully accessible to the makers and data collectors, and highly encourage questions.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Gestalt Perceptual Organization (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.4"><span class="blue">20.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use gestalt principles of grouping when creating assets and user interfaces.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use gestalt principles of grouping at a higher conceptual level, such as keeping objects simple and temporal closure.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use concepts of segregation&#8212;ground acts as a stable reference and figure emphasizes objects that can be interacted with.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_269"></a><a id="lev24.2"></a><strong><span class="font">24.2</span> Environmental Design (Chapter <a href="chapter21.html#ch21"><span class="blue">21</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>The Scene (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.1"><span class="blue">21.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Simplify the background and contextual geometry. Focus on fundamental geometry and interactive objects.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make sure geometry scaling is consistent. For realistic experiences, include familiar objects with standard sizes that are easily seen by the user.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Color and Lighting (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.2"><span class="blue">21.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use color to bring out emotions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use multiple colors and only slight variations of white light so users perceive the intended color of objects and color constancy is maintained.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Capture users&#8217; attention with bright colors that stand out.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Turn on and off color on specific objects to signify use or disable use.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Audio (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.3"><span class="blue">21.3</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use audio for situational awareness from all directions, adding emotional impact, cuing visual attention, conveying information without taxing the visual system, and providing unique cues that cannot be perceived through other sensory systems.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not make people deaf by not providing audio.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Do not overwhelm with sound.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use aggressive warning sounds only occasionally to grab attention.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use ambient sound effects to provide a sense of realism and presence.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use music to evoke emotion.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use audio with interfaces as feedback to the user.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use audio along with color to replace touch when haptics are not available.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Convey information through the spoken word.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Sampling and Aliasing (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.4"><span class="blue">21.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Avoid spatially high-frequency visual elements.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Environmental Wayfinding Aids (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.5"><span class="blue">21.5</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use environmental wayfinding aids to help users maintain a sense of their position and direction of travel, know where goals are located, and plan in their minds how to get there.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; <a id="page_270"></a>Use both explicit and subtle wayfinding aids.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Study the work of non-VR designers such as architectural design and urban planners.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Place landmarks strategically.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide tall landmarks so they can be seen from most places in the environment.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Differentiate areas of the environment with regions that have different characteristics.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use channels to restrict navigation options while providing a feeling of openness.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Place signs at nodes.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use edges to deter travel.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use visual handrails to guide navigation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Utilize simple spatial organization such as grid-like patterns.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Minimize violations of the overarching metaphor of the world structure.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Adding structure to abstract or scientific data can provide context, but be careful of imposing inappropriate structure on data that does not exist in the data itself. Consult with subject-matter experts before adding such cues to datasets.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Implement breadcrumbs, trails, markup tools, user-placed markers, and measurement tools for users to better understand and think about the environment, as well as to share information with other users.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Real-World Content (Section <a href="chapter21.html#lev21.6"><span class="blue">21.6</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For immersive film, reconsider the entire movie experience as the viewer being within and a part of the scene.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When capturing the world in 360&#176;, make sure that all equipment and people that are not part of the story are not visible to the camera.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For 360&#176; camera capture, remove stereoscopic cues in the down and up directions.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Capture light fields or true 3D data to enable motion parallax.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Empower scientists by enabling them to walk through their own datasets and see that data in new ways.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_271"></a><a id="lev24.3"></a><strong><span class="font">24.3</span> Affecting Behavior (Chapter <a href="chapter22.html#ch22"><span class="blue">22</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Personal Wayfinding Aids (Section <a href="chapter22.html#lev22.1"><span class="blue">22.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use abstract representations in maps to portray understanding of essential environmental concepts.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use &#8220;you-are-here&#8221; maps with arrows or field-of-view markings to convey both location and direction.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For large environments, allow the map to be scaled.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use forward-up maps when concurrently navigating and/or searching in an egocentric manner in order to enable easy matching between points on the map and corresponding landmarks in the environment.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use north-up maps for exocentric tasks (e.g., when users want (1) to familiarize themselves with the entire layout of the environment independent of where they are located or (2) to plan routes before navigating).</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Use compasses so users can easily direct themselves in the direction of intended travel.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Place a compass around the user, such as floating in space where it can be easily grabbed, surrounding the user at eye level, or surrounding the user at the feet.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Center of Action (Section <a href="chapter22.html#lev22.2"><span class="blue">22.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider breaking the scene around the user into zones.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Casual vs. High-End VR (Section <a href="chapter22.html#lev22.4"><span class="blue">22.4</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When creating content, take into account whether the system is wired or wireless.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; If virtual turning is implemented, move the controls/hands with the torso.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For wired systems, put the majority of content in the general forward direction.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Design and optimize for a single system, even when supporting multiple types of systems.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Characters, Avatars, and Social Networking (Section <a href="chapter22.html#lev22.5"><span class="blue">22.5</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When the bandwidth is available, map head tracking data to avatars&#8217; heads.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Unless the intent is for users to distinguish between computer-controlled character behavior and user-controlled avatars, make the computer-controlled characters behave in a similar manner as avatars (e.g., similar head movements).</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_272"></a>&#8226; Be careful of adding artificial eye movements to avatars to avoid the risk of conveying that the remote user is not paying attention.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To convey natural attention of a computer-controlled character, first move the eyes (if implemented), then the head, then the body.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; To get users to look in certain directions, use computer-controlled characters to place themselves between the user and the intended look direction, or have the characters look and/or point in the intended direction.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; For non-realistic experiences, use caricature to exaggerate the most important features of characters.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider not using legs for characters that move in order to reduce breaks-in-presence caused by awkward-looking leg movement.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Provide the ability for users to personalize their own avatars.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev24.4"></a><strong><span class="font">24.4</span> Transitioning to VR Content Creation (Chapter <a href="chapter23.html#ch23"><span class="blue">23</span></a>)</strong></h3>
<h6 class="h6a"><strong>Paradigm Shifts from Traditional Development to VR Development (Section <a href="chapter23.html#lev23.1"><span class="blue">23.1</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Study human perception and other disciplines, but be prepared to give up on concepts that do not work with VR.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Focus on the user experience as the experience is more important for VR than for any other medium.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Minimize sickness-inducing effects.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Calibrate often and excessively. Poor calibration is a major cause of motion sickness.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Make aesthetics secondary. Start instead with basic content and incrementally build while focusing on ease of use and maintaining essential requirements.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Give up on having all the action in one part of the scene.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Experiment excessively. There are unknowns and various forms of VR&#8212;what works in one situation might not work in another situation.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Consider core concepts of VR such as head and hand tracking from the start of the project.</p>
<h6 class="h6"><strong>Reusing Existing Content (Section <a href="chapter23.html#lev23.2"><span class="blue">23.2</span></a>)</strong></h6>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Instead of directly porting desktop applications to VR, reuse assets and refactor code where needed.</p>
<p class="indentbullet"><a id="page_273"></a>&#8226; Understand that geometric hacks (e.g., representing depth with textures) that work well with desktop systems often appear strange in VR.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be very careful of using desktop heads-up displays and targeting reticles as straightforward porting/implementation causes binocular-occlusion conflicts.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Replace desktop 2D hands/weapons with 3D models.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; When using tracked hand-held controllers, do not render the arms unless inverse kinematics is available.</p>
<p class="indentbullet">&#8226; Be careful of using a zoom mode.</p>
