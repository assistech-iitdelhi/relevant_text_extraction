<h2 class="h2p1"><strong>ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent">Many users report feeling sick after experiencing VR-type experiences, and this is perhaps the greatest challenge of VR. As an example, over an eight-month period, six people over the age of 55 were taken to the hospital for chest pain and nausea after going on Walt Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Mission: Space,&#8221; a $100 million VR ride. This is the most hospital visits for a single ride since Florida&#8217;s major theme parks agreed in 2001 to report any serious injuries to the state (Johnson, 2005). Disney also began placing vomit bags in the ride. More recently, John Carmack&#8212;legendary video game developer and CTO of Oculus&#8212;referenced his company&#8217;s unwillingness to &#8220;poison the well&#8221; (i.e., to cause motion sickness on a massive scale) by introducing consumer VR hardware too quickly (Carmack, 2015).</p>
<p class="indent">Part <a href="part03.html#part3"><span class="blue">III</span></a> focuses on adverse health effects of VR and their causes. An <strong>adverse health effect</strong> is any problem caused by a VR system or application that degrades a user&#8217;s health such as nausea, eye strain, headache, vertigo, physical injury, and transmitted disease. Causes include perceived self-motion through the environment, incorrect calibration, latency, physical hazards, and poor hygiene. In addition, such challenges can indirectly be more than a health problem. Users might adapt their behavior to avoid becoming sick, resulting in incorrect training for real-world tasks (Kennedy and Fowlkes, 1992). This is not just a danger for the user, as resulting aftereffects of VR usage (Section <a href="chapter13.html#lev13.4"><span class="blue">13.4</span></a>) can lead to public safety issues (e.g., vehicle accidents). We may never eliminate all the negative effects of VR for all users, but by understanding the problems and why they occur, we can design VR systems and applications to, at the very least, reduce their severity and duration.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><a id="page_160"></a><strong>VR Sickness</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Sickness resulting from VR goes by many names including motion sickness, cyber-sickness, and simulator sickness. These terms are often used interchangeably but are not completely synonymous, being differentiated primarily by their causes.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Motion sickness</strong> refers to adverse symptoms and readily observable signs that are associated with exposure to real (physical or visual) and/or apparent motion (Lawson, 2014).</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Cybersickness</strong> is visually induced motion sickness resulting from immersion in a computer-generated virtual world. The word cybersickness sounds like it implies any sickness resulting from computers or VR (the word cyber refers to relating or involving computers and does not refer to motion), but for some reason cybersickness has been defined throughout the literature to be<em>only motion sickness</em> resulting from VR usage. That definition is quite limiting as it doesn&#8217;t account for non-motion-sickness challenges of VR such as accommodation-vergence conflict, display flicker, fatigue, and poor hygiene. For example, a headache resulting from a VR experience due to accommodation-vergence conflict but no scene motion is not a form of cybersickness.</p>
<p class="indent"><strong>Simulator sickness</strong> is sickness that results from shortcomings of the simulation, but not from the actual situation that is being simulated (Pausch et al., 1992). For example, imperfect flight simulators can cause sickness, but such simulator sickness would not actually occur were the user in the real aircraft (although non-simulator sickness might occur). Simulator sickness most often refers to motion sickness resulting from apparent motion that does not match physical motion (rather that physical motion is actually zero motion, user motion, or motion created by a motion platform), but can also be caused by accommodation-vergence conflict (Section <a href="chapter13.html#lev13.1"><span class="blue">13.1</span></a>) and flicker (Section <a href="chapter13.html#lev13.3"><span class="blue">13.3</span></a>). Because simulator sickness does not include sickness that would result from the experience being simulated, sickness resulting from intense stressful games (e.g., that simulate life-and-death situations) is not simulator sickness. For example, acrophobia (a fear of heights that can cause anxiety) and vertigo resulting from looking down over a virtual cliff are not considered to be a form of simulator sickness (nor cybersickness). Some expert researchers also use the term simulator sickness to refer to sickness resulting from flight simulators implemented with world-fixed display and not sickness resulting from HMD usage (Stanney et al., 1997).</p>
<p class="indent">There is currently no generally accepted term that covers all sickness resulting from VR usage, and most users don&#8217;t know or care about the specific terminology. A general term is needed that is not restricted by specific causes. Thus, this book tends to stay away from the terms cybersickness and simulator sickness, and instead uses the term <strong>VR sickness</strong> or simply &#8220;sickness&#8221; when discussing any sickness caused by using VR, irrespective of the specific cause of that sickness. Motion sickness is used only when specifically discussing motion-induced sickness.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="page_161"></a><strong>Overview of Chapters</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Part <a href="part03.html#part3"><span class="blue">III</span></a></strong> is divided into several chapters about the negative health effects of VR that VR creators should be aware of.</p>
<p class="hangt"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter12.html#ch12"><span class="blue">12</span></a>, Motion Sickness,</strong> discusses scene motion and how such motion can cause sickness. Several theories are described that explain why motion sickness occurs. A unified model of motion sickness is presented that ties together all the theories.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter13.html#ch13"><span class="blue">13</span></a>, Eye Strain, Seizures, and Aftereffects,</strong> discusses how non-moving stimuli can also cause discomfort and adverse health effects. Known problems include accommodation-vergence conflict, binocular-occlusion conflict, and flicker. Aftereffects are also discussed, which can indirectly result from scene motion as well as non-moving visual stimuli.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter14.html#ch14"><span class="blue">14</span></a>, Hardware Challenges,</strong> discusses physical challenges involved with the use of VR equipment. This chapter discusses physical fatigue, headset fit, injury, and hygiene.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter15.html#ch15"><span class="blue">15</span></a>, Latency,</strong> discusses in detail how unintended scene motion and motion sickness can result from latency. Since latency is a primary contributor to VR sickness, latency and its sources are covered in detail.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter16.html#ch16"><span class="blue">16</span></a>, Measuring Sickness,</strong> discusses how researchers measure VR sickness. Collecting data to determine users&#8217; level of motion sickness is important to help improve upon the design of VR applications and to make VR experiences more comfortable. Three methods of measuring VR sickness are covered: The Kennedy Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, postural stability, and physiological measures.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter17.html#ch17"><span class="blue">17</span></a>, Summary of Factors That Contribute to Adverse Effects,</strong> summarizes the primary contributors to adverse health effects resulting from VR exposure. The factors are divided into system factors, individual user factors, and application design factors. In addition, trade-offs of presence vs. motion sickness are also briefly discussed.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter18.html#ch18"><span class="blue">18</span></a>, Examples of Reducing Adverse Effects,</strong> provides some examples of specific techniques that are used to make users more comfortable and reduce negative health effects.</p>
<p class="hanga"><strong>Chapter <a href="chapter19.html#ch19"><span class="blue">19</span></a>, Adverse Health Effects: Design Guidelines,</strong> summarizes the previous seven chapters and lists a number of actionable guidelines for improving comfort and reducing adverse health effects.</p>
