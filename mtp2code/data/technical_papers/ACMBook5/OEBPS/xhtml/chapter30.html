<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">Philosophy of Iterative Design</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Design has multiple meanings yet all are intimately related. <strong>Design</strong> is a created object, a process, and an action. Quality design focuses on utility, effectiveness, efficiency, elegance, delight, and the conveying of meaning [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>]. For the purposes of this book, design entails the entire creation of a VR experience from information gathering and goal setting to delivery and product enhancement/support.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev30.1"></a><a id="pg373lev1"></a><span class="font">30.1</span> <strong>VR Is Both an Art and a Science</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">VR is an art because we have to be prolific in creating new experiences based off of common sense, rules of thumb, cultural metaphors, creative outside-the-box thinking, etc. VR is an art also because creating new worlds enables us to throw away many of the rules of the real world; VR requires innovation. Creating a quality VR experience is not just about optimizing a set of algorithms. It is more imperative for the humans behind the creation to decide on the right things to design instead of perfectly designing the wrong things. VR designers seek to find what is useful, whether realistic or magical.</p>
<p class="indent">VR is a science because our intuition of what will work often doesn&#8217;t work in practice. We have to get users to test our ideas, collect data, and analyze that data to help determine how to improve the experience. As in programming, <strong>iterative design</strong> consists of quickly testing many implementations, continually improving upon previous ideas. The faster we can obtain quality answers to meaningful questions, the faster we can iterate toward better and better experiences.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev30.2"></a><span class="font">30.2</span> <strong>Human-Centered Design</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The measure of progress for a VR project is the user experience. If the experience is improved, then progress is being made. Traditional software development measures, such as the number of lines of code, are very different from measures that should <a id="page_374"></a>be used for VR progress. Such measures are largely useless for VR. A well-working interaction technique that takes a couple of hours to integrate is worth far more than tens of thousands of lines of code that took months of work but doesn&#8217;t feel right. A brilliantly engineered solution is irrelevant if it doesn&#8217;t work for the human.</p>
<p class="indent">Bad VR insists users perform abnormally, to adapt themselves to the peculiar demands of the system. When users are not able to meet the inhuman expectations of the virtual environment, then there is a design problem. Human-centered design errors are often only discovered when those external to the project experience the creation. Obtaining feedback from real users is critical early in the project, for if human-centered design error is discovered near ship time, then the entire project may be deemed a failure instead of many small failures discovered and fixed in early iterations.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev30.3"></a><span class="font">30.3</span> Continuous Discovery through Iteration</h3>
<p class="noindent">A core concept of VR design is that discovery should always be occurring. <strong>Continuous discovery</strong> is the ongoing process of engaging users during the design and development process [<a href="reference.html#ref102"><span class="blue">Gothelf and Seiden 2013</span></a>]. The goal of discovery is to understand what users <a id="pg374lev1"></a>want to do, why they want to do it, and how they can best do it.</p>
<p class="indent">Knowing or rationalizing everything in advance for building complex systems results in projects becoming over-budget, overdue performance disasters [<a href="reference.html#ref33"><span class="blue">Brooks 2010</span></a>]. This is not only because there are not-yet known answers to questions the team has at the beginning, but also because the team doesn&#8217;t yet know what they don&#8217;t know. Questions will lead to more questions that were not initially considered. Discovering what one did not formerly even consider is where new insights and breakthroughs in design most often occur.</p>
<p class="indent">Iteration is more important for developing VR systems than it is for developing non-VR systems [<a href="reference.html#ref336"><span class="blue">Wingrave and LaViola 2010</span></a>]. The possibilities with VR extend beyond what is possible with reality, yet doing one thing badly can have severe consequences. Even if everything were known about VR, then the number of factors and combinations of factors that can go into a VR experience explodes exponentially. Thus, little can be known in advance and every project will be unique.</p>
<p class="indent">We can&#8217;t afford to wait until the end of the project to see if everything works. (Hint: It won&#8217;t.) Learning, change, and innovation are much less expensive at the beginning than at the end, and there must be many options available that enable fast adjustments as necessary. The question, then, is not if iterative design should be used but how to most quickly and effectively iterate. This is accomplished via rapid prototyping and getting feedback from experts and representative users as quickly <a id="page_375"></a>and as often as possible. As advocated by <em>The Lean Startup</em> [<a href="reference.html#ref267"><span class="blue">Ries 2011</span></a>], fail early and fail often. Each failure teaches about what to do better. Failures are essential for exploration, creativity, and innovation. If failure is not occurring often, then one is not innovating enough and breakthroughs are not likely to occur. It is fairly easy to create a safe VR experience where there is no risk of learning. But that is also the route to a dull, uninteresting experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Even if everything could be known at the start of the project, change happens over time. The reality of life, business, and technical advancement dictate that what was important yesterday may not be important today. When reality gets in the way of the plan, then that reality always wins. Another challenge that is especially true for VR projects is that when one part of the application changes, it rarely occurs in isolation. Always be on the lookout for changes in assumptions, technology, and business. Then change course as necessary through adaptive planning.</p>
<p class="indent">For those new to VR (this includes everyone on the team from business development to programmers), the first step of discovery is to step into the role of user and try a broad range of existing VR experiences, making notes of what works and what doesn&#8217;t work. Then, new insights are discovered by prototyping new or modified ideas and getting feedback from users. In fact, this is more important than planning and <a id="pg375lev1"></a>pre-analysis. There is more value in getting a bad prototype out than spending days thinking, considering, and debating. It is important to create a culture of accepting failure, especially early in a VR project, so that team members feel it is safe to experiment. Such experimentation encourages creativity and innovation and leads to effective VR. Feedback and measurement from real application beats opinions based on theory.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end, the success or failure of the VR experience isn&#8217;t the team&#8217;s decision&#8212;it&#8217;s the consumers of the experience. The sooner the team can discover what gets results for users, then instead of iterating in an arbitrary direction, the team can iterate toward success.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev30.4"></a><span class="font">30.4</span> There Is No One Way&#8212;Processes Are Project Dependent</h3>
<p class="noindent">In any field, no single design process is appropriate for every project. This is even truer for VR for multiple reasons. Even though VR research has occurred over multiple decades, the community is constantly learning/changing and there are not yet (and there may never be) standardized processes to follow. VR covers a broad range of industries and applications. For example, creating an assembly-line automotive training system is going to have a very different process than creating an immersive film. Even within the same project there are many factors that will determine what <a id="page_376"></a>process is most appropriate at the time. Factors include the current size of the team, approaching deadlines, and how far along the project is. Because there are so many unknowns, and large variance for what is known, what is most appropriate must be determined on a project-by-project basis, and &#8220;appropriate&#8221; will change as the project iterates toward a solution.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the variety of VR project demands, why define processes in advance at all? There must be some way to bring order to chaos; otherwise, a final cohesive application can&#8217;t be achieved. At some point, approval must be obtained to move ahead. Schedules and budgets cannot be overrun. Customers must be kept satisfied. Processes in some form are indeed required for these things to happen. However, they should not be used blindly. Understanding various processes, and the advantages and disadvantages of each, enables a team to selectively choose from a library of processes as appropriate and to integrate them together as needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Individual team members and communication between team members should have priority over sticking to a formal process, and responding to change should have priority over following a plan [<a href="reference.html#ref173"><span class="blue">Larman 2004</span></a>]. This does not mean processes and plans do not matter. It does mean ongoing input from individuals, communication between the team, and appropriate change are more important. Good processes will support <a id="pg376lev1"></a>these things rather than hinder them.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, a primary goal of processes is to help identify and prioritize matters of most importance, providing focus and clarity to the team. Good processes also provide for easy and swift exceptions&#8212;all rules can be broken when appropriate. The specifics of what processes fit a project are best chosen based on experience. There are no rules or algorithm that state, which process is most appropriate for a specific project although this book does provide some general guidelines. If it is not clear what specific processes to start with, then just pick some and go with them. Just like iterating upon the project, you will iterate upon the processes, improving upon them as you use and learn from them. Do not become attached to the processes and be willing to throw them out if and when they are not working.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev30.5"></a><span class="font">30.5</span> Teams</h3>
<p class="noindent">VR by its nature is cross-disciplinary and communication between teammates is essential for VR development. Team communication is about externalizing one&#8217;s work [<a href="reference.html#ref102"><span class="blue">Gothelf and Seiden 2013</span></a>] to others through spoken conversation, sketches, whiteboards, foamcore boards, artifact walls, printouts, sticky notes, and of course prototype demos. All but spoken conversation helps to equalize team member input, regardless of whether someone is loud or quiet. It is very important to keep such forms <a id="page_377"></a>of structural communication informal and raw as long as possible. More formal documentation should trail, not lead. Such communication should be easily modifiable with a way to easily determine what has been updated. Keep teams small to maximize communication. Individuals will likely have multiple roles. If the project is being developed as part of a larger organization, break groups into smaller teams.</p>
<p class="indent">A team effort often (but not always!) results in bigger and better results than an individual due to input from a range of opinions/viewpoints. However, design should not be done by committee. Collaborative design should be led by a single authoritative director (Section <a href="chapter20.html#lev20.3"><span class="blue">20.3</span></a>) who listens well but acts as a final decision maker on high-level decisions (the one exception to this is for teams of only two individuals, similar to pair programming). This director needs to be completely trusted both by the team working with him as well as by those on the business/finance side. The director should clearly understand the conceptual design of the entire project. If it is not possible for the director to understand how everything is connected, then the design is overcomplicated and should be simplified.</p>
<p class="indent">The entire team should be on board with the overarching design philosophy. Not only should individuals be aware of what other team members are working on but also each individual should be actively involved with other&#8217;s work to some degree. That is, everyone should co-create, not just critique. The entire team should work toward getting the design right through prototypes and feedback from users before making final decisions on polishing what has been built. This also prevents individuals from becoming attached to their creations, which results in less willingness to give up those creations.</p>
<p class="indent">Some team members might be subject-matter experts but have little experience with VR so they don&#8217;t know what is possible or the limitation of today&#8217;s technology. Other team members may be VR experts but have little understanding of the problem domain. Those with a traditional design background should understand challenges of VR implementation. Those with a programming background should be open to learning from other team members, external suggestions from those experienced in VR, other disciplines, and user feedback. If any individual on a team is close minded to ideas that are not his own and/or other disciplines, then that individual is going to be a hindrance to creating compelling VR experiences (much more so than any other discipline due to the cross-disciplinary nature of VR). Warn the team member to change his attitude, and if he is unwilling to do so then remove him from the project as soon as possible as if cancer has invaded the team (because like cancer, such attitudes can kill a VR project).</p>
