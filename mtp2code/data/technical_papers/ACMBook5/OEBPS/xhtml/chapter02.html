<h2 class="h2b"><span class="blue">A History of VR</span></h2>
<p class="chblock"><em>When anything new comes along, everyone, like a child discovering the world, thinks that they&#8217;ve invented it, but you scratch a little and you find a caveman scratching on a wall is creating virtual reality in a sense. What is new here is that more sophisticated instruments give you the power to do it more easily</em>.</p>
<p class="chattribute">&#8212;Morton Heilig [<a href="reference.html#ref111"><span class="blue">Hamit 1993</span></a>]</p>
<p class="noindent">Precursors to what we think of today as VR go back as far as humans have had imaginations and the ability to communicate through the spoken word and cave drawings <a id="pg15lev1"></a>(what could be called analog VR). The Egyptians, Chaldeans, Jews, Romans, and Greeks used magical illusions to entertain and control the masses. In the Middle Ages, magicians used smoke and concave mirrors to produce faint ghost and demon illusions to gull naive apprentices as well as larger audiences [<a href="reference.html#ref128"><span class="blue">Hopkins 2013</span></a>]. Although the words and implementation have changed over the centuries, the core goals of creating the illusion of conveying that which is not actually present and capturing our imaginations remain the same.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev2.1"></a><span class="font">2.1</span> The 1800s</h3>
<p class="noindent">The static version of today&#8217;s stereoscopic 3D TVs is called a stereoscope and was invented before photography in 1832 by Sir Charles Wheatstone [<a href="reference.html#ref106"><span class="blue">Gregory 1997</span></a>]. As shown in Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.2"><span class="blue">2.2</span></a>, the device used mirrors angled at 45&#176; to reflect images into the eye from the left and right side.</p>
<p class="indent">David Brewster, who earlier invented the kaleidoscope, used lenses to make a smaller consumer-friendly hand-held stereoscope (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.3"><span class="blue">2.3</span></a>). His stereoscope was demonstrated at the 1851 Exhibition at the Crystal Palace where Queen Victoria found it quite pleasing. Later the poet Oliver Wendell Holmes stated &#8220;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;is a surprise such as no painting ever produced. The mind feels its way into the very depths of the picture.&#8221; [<a href="reference.html#ref347"><span class="blue">Zone 2007</span></a>]. By 1856 Brewster estimated over a half million stereoscopes had been sold [<a href="reference.html#ref30"><span class="blue">Brewster 1856</span></a>]. This first 3D craze included various forms of the stereoscope, <a id="pg16lev1"></a>including self-assembled cardboard versions with moving images controlled by the hand in 1860 [<a href="reference.html#ref347"><span class="blue">Zone 2007</span></a>]. One company alone sold a million stereoscopic views in 1862. Brewster&#8217;s design is conceptually the same as the 20th century View-Master and today&#8217;s Google Cardboard. In the case of Google Cardboard and similar phone-based VR systems, a cellular phone is used to display the images in place of the actual physical images themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Many years later, a 360&#176; VR-type display known as the Haunted Swing was shown at the &#8217;95 Midwinter Fair in San Francisco, and is still one of the most compelling technical demonstrations of an illusion to this day. The demo consisted of a room and large swing that held approximately 40 people. After the audience seated themselves, the swing was put in motion and as the swing oscillated, users felt motion similar to being in an elevator while they involuntarily clutched their seats. In fact, the swing hardly moved at all, but the surrounding room moved substantially, resulting in the sense of self-motion (Section <a href="chapter09.html#lev9.3.10"><span class="blue">9.3.10</span></a>) and motion sickness (Chapter <a href="chapter12.html#ch12"><span class="blue">12</span></a>). The date was not 1995, but was 1895 [<a href="reference.html#ref339"><span class="blue">Wood 1895</span></a>].</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_18"></a>It was also in 1895 that film began to go mainstream; and when the audience saw a virtual train coming at them through the screen in the short film &#8220;L&#8217;Arriv&#233;e d&#8217;un train en gare de La Ciotat,&#8221; some people reportedly screamed and ran to the back of the room. Although the screaming and running away is more rumor than verified reports, there was certainly hype, excitement, and fear about the new artistic medium, perhaps similar to what is happening with VR today.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev2.2"></a><span class="font">2.2</span> The 1900s</h3>
<p class="noindent">VR-related innovation continued in the 1900s that moved beyond simply presenting visual images. New interaction concepts started to emerge that might be considered novel for even today&#8217;s VR systems. For example, Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.4"><span class="blue">2.4</span></a> shows what is a head-worn gun pointing and firing device patented by Albert Pratt in 1916 [<a href="reference.html#ref248"><span class="blue">Pratt 1916</span></a>]. No hand tracking is required to fire this device as the interface consists of a tube the user blows through.</p>

Link and Marion Clayton Link Collections, Binghamton University Libraries&#8217; Special Collections and University Archives, Binghamton University)</p>
<p class="indent">A little over a decade after Pratt received his weapon patent, Edwin Link developed the first simple mechanical flight simulator, a fuselage-like device with a cockpit and controls that produced the motions and sensations of flying (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.5"><span class="blue">2.5</span></a>). Surprisingly, his intended client&#8212;the military&#8212;was not initially interested, so he pivoted to selling to amusement parks. By 1935, the Army Air Corps ordered six systems and by the end of World War II, Link had sold 10,000 systems. Link trainers eventually evolved into astronaut training systems and advanced flight simulators complete with motion platform and real-time computer-generated imagery, and today is Link Simulation &#38; Training, a division of L-3 Communications. Since 1991, the Link Foundation Advanced Simulation and Training Fellowship Program has funded many graduate students in their pursuits of improving upon VR systems, including work in computer graphics, latency, spatialized audio, avatars, and haptics [<a href="reference.html#ref187"><span class="blue">Link 2015</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">As early 20th century technologies started to be built, science fiction and questions inquiring about what makes reality started to become popular. In 1935, for example, <a id="pg20lev1"></a>science fiction readers got excited about a surprisingly similar future that we now aspire to with head-mounted displays and other equipment through the book <em>Pygmalion&#8217;s Spectacles</em> (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.6"><span class="blue">2.6</span></a>). The story opens with the words &#8220;But what is reality?&#8221; written by a professor friend of George Berkeley, the Father of Idealism (the philosophy that reality is mentally constructed) and for whom the University of California, Berkeley, is named. The professor then explains a set of eyeglasses along with other equipment that replaces real-world stimuli with artificial stimuli. The demo consists of a quite compelling interactive and immersive world where &#8220;The story is all about you, and you are in it&#8221; through vision sound, taste, smell, and even touch. One of the virtual characters calls the world Paracosma&#8212;Greek for &#8220;land beyond-the-world.&#8221; The demo is so good that the main character, although skeptical at first, becomes convinced that it is no longer illusion, but reality itself. Today there are countless books ranging from philosophy to science fiction that discuss the illusion of reality.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_20"></a><a id="fig2.6"></a><img src="../images/f0020-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 2.6</span> <em>Pygmalion&#8217;s Spectacles</em> is perhaps the first science fiction story written about an alternate world that is perceived through eyeglasses and other sensory equipment.</strong> (From <a href="reference.html#ref326"><span class="blue">Weinbaum</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref326"><span class="blue">1935</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps inspired by <em>Pygmalion&#8217;s Spectacles</em>, McCollum patented the first stereoscopic television glasses in 1945. Unfortunately, there is no record of the device ever actually having been built.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1950s Morton Heilig designed both a head-mounted display and a world-fixed display. The head-mounted display (HMD) patent [<a href="reference.html#ref117"><span class="blue">Heilig 1960</span></a>] shown in Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.7"><span class="blue">2.7</span></a> claims lenses that enable a 140&#176; horizontal and vertical field of view, stereo earphones, and air discharge nozzles that provide a sense of breezes at different temperatures as well as scent. He called his world-fixed display the Sensorama. As can be seen in Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.8"><span class="blue">2.8</span></a>, the Sensorama was created for immersive film and it provided stereoscopic color views with a wide field of view, stereo sounds, seat tilting, vibrations, smell, and wind [<a href="reference.html#ref118"><span class="blue">Heilig 1992</span></a>].</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_21"></a><a id="fig2.7"></a><img src="../images/f0021-01.png" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 2.7</span> A drawing from Heilig&#8217;s 1960 Stereoscopic Television Apparatus patent.</strong> (From <a href="reference.html#ref117"><span class="blue">Heilig</span></a> <a id="pg21lev1"></a>[<a href="reference.html#ref117"><span class="blue">1960</span></a>])</p>
<p class="indent">In 1961, Philco Corporation engineers built the first actual working tracked HMD that included head tracking (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.9"><span class="blue">2.9</span></a>). As the user moved his head, a camera in a different room moved so the user could see as if he were at the other location. This was the world&#8217;s first working telepresence system.</p>
<p class="indent">One year later IBM was awarded a patent for the first glove input device (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.10"><span class="blue">2.10</span></a>). This glove was designed as a comfortable alternative to keyboard entry, and a sensor for each finger could recognize multiple finger positions. Four possible positions for each finger with a glove in each hand resulted in 1,048,575 possible input combinations. Glove input, albeit with very different implementations, later became a common VR input device in the 1990s.</p>
<p class="indent">Starting in 1965, Tom Furness and others at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base worked on visually coupled systems for pilots that consisted of head-mounted displays (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.11"><span class="blue">2.11</span></a>, left). While Furness was developing head-mounted displays at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ivan Sutherland was doing similar work at Harvard and the University of Utah. Sutherland is known as the first to demonstrate a head-mounted display that used head tracking and computer-generated imagery [<a href="reference.html#ref231"><span class="blue">Oakes 2007</span></a>]. The system was called the Sword of Damocles (Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.11"><span class="blue">2.11</span></a>, right), named after the story of King Damocles who, with a sword hanging above his head by a single hair of a horse&#8217;s tail, was in constant peril. The story is a metaphor that can be applied to VR technology: (1) with great power comes great responsibility; (2) precarious situations give a sense of foreboding; and (3) as stated by <a href="reference.html#ref280"><span class="blue">Shakespeare</span></a> [<a href="reference.html#ref280"><span class="blue">1598</span></a>] in <em>Henry IV</em>, &#8220;uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.&#8221; All these seem very relevant for both VR developers and VR users even today.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., inspired by Ivan Sutherland&#8217;s vision of the Ultimate Display [<a href="reference.html#ref302"><span class="blue">Sutherland 1965</span></a>], established a new research program in interactive graphics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with the initial focus being on molecular graphics. This not only resulted in a visual interaction with simulated molecules but also included force feedback where the docking of simulated molecules could be felt. Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.12"><span class="blue">2.12</span></a> shows the resulting Grope-III system that Dr. Brooks and his team built. UNC has since focused on building various VR systems and applications with the intent to help practitioners solve real problems ranging from architectural visualization to surgical simulation.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1982, Atari Research, led by legendary computer scientist Alan Kay, was formed to explore the future of entertainment. The Atari research team, which included Scott Fisher, Jaron Lanier, Thomas Zimmerman, Scott Foster, and Beth Wenzel, brainstormed novel ways of interacting with computers and designed technologies that would soon be essential for commercializing VR systems.</p>

<p class="caption"><strong><span class="blue">Figure 2.13</span> The NASA VIEW System.</strong> (Courtesy of NASA/S.S. Fisher, W. Sisler, 1988)</p>
<p class="indent">In 1985, Scott Fisher, now at NASA Ames, along with other NASA researchers developed the first commercially viable, stereoscopic head-tracked HMD with a wide field of view, called the Virtual Visual Environment Display (VIVED). It was based on a scuba diver&#8217;s face mask with the displays provided by two Citizen Pocket TVs (Scott <a id="pg26lev1"></a>Fisher, personal communication, Aug 25, 2015). Scott Foster and Beth Wenzel built a system called the Convolvotron that provided localized 3D sounds. The VR system was unprecedented as the HMD could be produced at a relatively affordable price, and as a result the VR industry was born. Figure <a href="chapter02.html#fig2.13"><span class="blue">2.13</span></a> shows a later system called the VIEW (Virtual Interface Environment Workstation) system.</p>
<p class="indent">Jaron Lanier and Thomas Zimmerman left Atari in 1985 to start VPL Research (VPL stands for Visual Programming Language) where they built commercial VR gloves, head-mounted displays, and software. During this time Jaron coined the term &#8220;virtual reality.&#8221; In addition to building and selling head-mounted displays, VPL built the Dataglove specified by NASA&#8212;a VR glove with optical flex sensors to measure finger bending and tactile vibrator feedback [<a href="reference.html#ref345"><span class="blue">Zimmerman et al. 1987</span></a>].</p>
<p class="indent">VR exploded in the 1990s with various companies focusing mostly on the professional research market and location-based entertainment. Examples of the more well-known newly formed VR companies were Virtuality, Division, and Fakespace. Existing companies such as Sega, Disney, and General Motors, as well as numerous universities and the military, also started to more extensively experiment with VR technologies. Movies were made, numerous books were written, journals emerged, and conferences formed&#8212;all focused exclusively on VR. In 1993, <em>Wired</em> magazine predicted that within five years more than one in ten people would wear HMDs while <a id="page_27"></a>traveling in buses, trains, and planes [<a href="reference.html#ref228"><span class="blue">Negroponte 1993</span></a>]. In 1995, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that Virtuality Managing Director Jonathan Waldern predicted the VR market to reach $4 billion by 1998 [<a href="reference.html#ref13"><span class="blue">Bailey 1995</span></a>]. It seemed VR was about to change the world and there was nothing that could stop it. Unfortunately, technology could not support the promises of VR. In 1996, the VR industry peaked and then started to slowly contract with most VR companies, including Virtuality, going out of business by 1998.</p>
<h3 class="h3"><a id="lev2.3"></a><span class="blue"><span class="font">2.3</span></span> The 2000s</h3>
<p class="noindent">The first decade of the 21st century is known as the &#8220;VR winter.&#8221; Although there was little mainstream media attention given to VR from 2000 to 2012, VR research continued in depth at corporate, government, academic, and military research laboratories around the world. The VR community started to turn toward human-centered design with an emphasis on user studies, and it became difficult to get a VR paper accepted at a conference without including some form of formal evaluation. Thousands of VR-related research papers from this era contain a wealth of knowledge that today is unfortunately largely unknown and ignored by those new to VR.</p>
<p class="indent">A wide field of view was a major missing component of consumer HMDs in the <a id="pg27lev1"></a>1990s, and without it users were just not getting the &#8220;magic&#8221; feeling of presence (Mark Bolas, personal communication, June 13, 2015). In 2006, Mark Bolas of USC&#8217;s MxR Lab and Ian McDowall of Fakespace Labs created a 150&#176; field of view HMD called the Wide5, which the lab later used to study the effects of field of view on the user experience and behavior. For example, users can more accurately judge distances when walking to a target when they have a larger field of view [<a href="reference.html#ref152"><span class="blue">Jones et al. 2012</span></a>]. The team&#8217;s research led to the low-cost Field of View To Go (FOV2GO), which was shown at the IEEE VR 2012 conference in Orange County, California, where the device won the Best Demo Award and was part of the MxR Lab&#8217;s Open-source project that is the precursor to most of today&#8217;s consumer HMDs. Around that time, a member of that lab named Palmer Luckey started sharing his prototype on Meant to be Seen (<span class="weblink"><a href="http://mtbs3D.com">mtbs3D.com</a></span>) where he was a forum moderator and where he first met John Carmack (now CTO of Oculus VR) and formed Oculus VR. Shortly after that he left the lab and launched the Oculus Rift Kickstarter. The hacker community and media latched onto VR once again. Companies ranging from start-ups to the Fortune 500 began to see the value of VR and started providing resources for VR development, including Facebook, which acquired Oculus VR in 2014 for $2 billion. The new era of VR was born.</p>
