Patnaik et al. [2011, 2012] introduced a system called EMRView, which is one of the first attempts for mining patientsâ€™ history at the big data scale by processing millions of patient records. EMRView mines the precedence relationships between events to identify and visualize partially ordered information encoded in key classes of patients. The high-level workflow of EMRView is shown in Figure 5.2, and it involves discovering frequent episodes using itemset mining techniques, tracking the order of the diagnostic codes in the discovered episodes, and learning partial orders using PQtree algorithm.
Figure 5.2Workflow of EMRView system. The three tasks of (i) mining parallel episodes, (ii) tracking serial extensions, and (iii) learning partial orders are performed to uncover partially ordered information in EMR data. Reproduced from Patnaik et al. [2011].
