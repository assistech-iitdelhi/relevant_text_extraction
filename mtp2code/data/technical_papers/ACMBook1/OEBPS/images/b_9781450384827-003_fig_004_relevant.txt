As shown in Figure 3.4, Freksa generalized interval relations by using semi-intervals with 11 operators: older, younger, head to head, survives, survived by, tail to tail, precedes, succeeds, contemporary, born before death and died before birth. Semi-intervals allow for a flexible representation when partial or incomplete knowledge needs to be handled because operations are applied on part of an interval and not the whole.

Figure 3.4Eleven semi-interval relationships. Question marks (?) in the pictorial illustration stand for either the symbol denoting the event depicted in the same line (X or Y) or for a blank. The number of question marks reflects the number of qualitatively alternative implementations of the given relation [Freksa 1992].
