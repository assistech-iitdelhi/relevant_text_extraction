Inspired by the e-chronicle concept [Westermann and Jain 2007], we propose using a data structure called Media JSON to capture all required information about an event. In Media JSON, an event is not merely a symbol or a tag, but it is a datum with multiple facets and properties. Figure 2.3 shows a chronicle of multiple events forming an event stream. Each event is represented as a JSON object and contains five basic event facets and some event properties that are tailored to each event type.
