 In other words, the system distinguishes between locations only if it helps determine what the user is doing. The following venue categories are considered: arts and entertainment, collage and university, academic building, gym, nightlife spot, outdoors and recreation, store, mall, shop, food, cafe, and restaurant. Also, the app stores the userâ€™s home address. Figure 6.25 shows location distribution for seven users based on the percentage of time they spent at each location. The amount of time spent at different places reveals a lot of information about a user. For instance, Figure 6.25 suggests that user 1 spent majority of her time at home while user 3 spent considerable time at school. User 2 visits the gym frequently while food places and malls are of interest for users 7 and 4, respectively.
