 Taking the concept of e-chronicles to track a person’s activity, Oh and Jain [2019] considered the problem of recognizing daily life events by employing the commonly used multimedia data obtained from a smartphone and wearable device and built a knowledge graph that semantically enriches daily events from low-level daily activities. They argued that although continuously and independently performing activities of daily living (ADL) are important in evaluating a person’s current health state, this concept can be extended and made significantly more effective by enriching daily activities with daily events to characterize, understand, and guide lifestyle. As depicted in Figure 2.1, Oh and Jain [2019] show that a person’s single daily activity, such as eating or working, cannot provide enough information about the person except for his ability or inability to perform the activity. Meanwhile, an event, such as a work dinner with a colleague at a restaurant, provides a lot more information.
Figure 2.1Enriching daily activities with daily events. D1: sleeping, D2: eating, D3: commuting, D4: working, D5: commuting, D6: eating. Events are a common concept in human daily life that represents the aggregation of activities and other attributes into meaningful semantic entities [Oh and Jain 2019].
