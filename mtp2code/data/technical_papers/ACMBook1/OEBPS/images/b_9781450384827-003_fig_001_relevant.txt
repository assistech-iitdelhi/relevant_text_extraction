In this chapter, we overview state-of-the-art techniques related to mining temporal data to investigate which algorithms are capable of building explanatory models for emerging applications. The literature related to temporal data mining is scattered across different domains. We characterized state-of-the-art based on algorithm objectives and input data types to four broad categories shown in Figure 3.1. Algorithms are either descriptive or predictive. Pattern discovery algorithms belong to the descriptive class and are designed with the goals of inferring and investigating associations in the data. Classification and clustering algorithms belong to the prediction class and have the goals of predicting and forecasting unseen data. However, there are some cases where such distinctions between algorithms become blurred due to the inherent multidisciplinary nature of temporal data mining.
