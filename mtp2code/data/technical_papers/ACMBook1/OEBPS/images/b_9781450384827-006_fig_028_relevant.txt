Since the study was conducted for 4 to 8 weeks, we could analyze the change of commute behaviors and activity levels in some participants. Figures 6.27 and 6.28 illustrate the sequential co-occurrence frequency of multiple patterns for two different users. The occurrence frequency of a pattern accumulates over time. Therefore, a sharp increasing slope within a limited time interval in the line graph indicates that the pattern was repeated often during that time. In addition, an almost flat line in the graph suggests the pattern did not occur frequently.However, a clear decrease in using a bicycle for commute purposes is visible in Figure 6.28 during the third and fourth weeks, which results in a decrease in activity level.
