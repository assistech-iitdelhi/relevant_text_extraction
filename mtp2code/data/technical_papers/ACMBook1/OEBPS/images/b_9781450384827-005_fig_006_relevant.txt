CASTing is a procedure for identification of consensus sequences of DNA to which a protein, for example, a transcription factor, may bind. In Figure 5.6, when 31 random protein complexes are given as input, GLAM2 discovers the CAGGTG motif and extends the GATA motif on the right by three columns.
Figure 5.6The GLAM2 alignment applied on clones shown in Figure 5.5 is demonstrated on the top, and the information content LOGO corresponding to the alignment is shown on the bottom. Reproduced from Frith et al. [2008].
