Figure 6.12 shows the overall framework for analyzing and modeling asthma risk factors. Our goal is to detect the prevalence of asthma by finding complex interrelations between air pollution, meteorological factors, and asthma exacerbation. Once a burst in asthma-related messages in a social media platform is detected, the historical physical sensory data within a one-week time window preceding the burst are analyzed to find a set of complex risk factor patterns that might have resulted in the burst.
