In the third experiment, we analyzed commonly occurring co-occurrence patterns across all users. Figure 6.30 shows common sequential co-occurrence patterns across multiple users. Each cell indicates the percentage of users with a specific pattern in their personicle. We only show those patterns with at least 60confidence. Figure 6.30(a) shows sequential co-occurrence patterns (event types in x axes follow event types in y axes within an hour). The most frequent pattern that occurs in 78% of users is phone call followed by SMS within an hour. Other common patterns are: attending class followed by studying, using phone followed by sleeping, and vehicle commute followed by arriving home. Figure 6.30(b) shows concurrent co-occurrence patterns. The most frequent pattern in this case is using social networking apps while dining. The next common patterns are: checking email while studying and sending text while studying.
