In this experiment we used concurrent co-occurrence matrix to investigate users’ interactions with their phones while they are engaged in other activities. Figure 6.29 displays an interesting result for one of the users. There is a clear co-occurrence between surfing the web, checking emails, and using social networking apps while the person is attending class. This analysis indicates multitasking in the classroom and suggests the user was bored or distracted during her classes.
