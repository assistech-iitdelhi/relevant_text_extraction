To analyze the functionality of the algorithm, the authors applied GLAM2 to discover a model of a bipartite DNA-binding motif associated with the LMO2 gene. Figure 5.5 shows two motifs, a CAGGTG and a GATA, separated by a spacer of length 8 to 10 basepairs determined using the CAST-ing technique [Wadman et al. 1997]. CASTing is a procedure for identification of consensus sequences of DNA to which a protein, for example, a transcription factor, may bind.

Figure 5.4A typical motif alignment from GLAM2. The stars indicate the key positions. The residues inserted between key positions are not considered aligned to each other; their column placement is arbitrary. The numbers on either side of the aligned segments indicate the coordinates of each segment within the sequence. The decimal numbers on the right are the marginal scores of each aligned segment.
