All relevant data streams for a person should be collected for as long a period as possible. These data streams may be converted to event streams. Such a stream is shown in Figure 7.1 for four different data streams that we will use to illustrate our thinking. Many more such streams may be collected for a person. The goal of collecting such streams is to build a personal model using this data. Event mining is discussed in this book as a concrete example of how to build such a model.
Figure 7.1Four different data streams that are converted to different types of events related to food, stress, activity, and sleep. These event streams are used both for hypotheses formation as well as hypothesis verification by an expert who has access to domain knowledge sources. After a hypothesis is verified, it is added to the personal model, which plays an important role in all lifestyle recommendations.
