The overall predictive maintenance workflow and a piece of a log file containing event information are represented in Figures 5.7 and 5.8, respectively. An event consists of a timestamp (indicating when the event occurred), a message text (either fully unstructured or generated from a template) describing the event, an event code (representing the category of a group of similar message text), and event severity. Logs are usually broken into day-long pieces that contain tens of thousands of events. The authors applied multi-instance learning (MIL) on multiple instances (daily logs) that are labeled positive or negative. If a batch of logs within a certain time interval is labeled negative, it means all the instances in it are negative and no failure has occurred according to the service notifications. A positive batch indicates that it contains at least one positive log. The results are then used to build a classifier that is used to label the logs.
