Figure 6.23 shows the high-level architecture of the objective self platform. This architecture has three main components: data ingestion, life event recognition, and EventMiner data-driven and hypothesis-driven operators. Data ingestion uses various sensors and pre-processing modules to extract appropriate attributes from raw sensor measurements. Life event recognition assigns the most appropriate life event and populates eventâ€™s properties from a set of predefined event classes based on attributes of the data.
