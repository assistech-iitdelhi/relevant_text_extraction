Figure 6.2 shows an example of three event streams and different types of events in each stream. Pattern 1 indicates that E2 is followed by E1 in the first event stream. Pattern 2 indicates that E1 is followed by E′3 is followed by E′′2 across the three event streams. Frequency of a pattern is the number of occurrences of the pattern in an event stream.
Figure 6.2Sample event streams ES(1), ES(2), and ES(3) and their corresponding event types. Patterns 1 and 2 are conditional sequential patterns, each one with two occurrences.
