Since the study was conducted for 4 to 8 weeks, we could analyze the change of commute behaviors and activity levels in some participants. Figures 6.27 and 6.28 illustrate the sequential co-occurrence frequency of multiple patterns for two different users. The occurrence frequency of a pattern accumulates over time. Therefore, a sharp increasing slope within a limited time interval in the line graph indicates that the pattern was repeated often during that time. In addition, an almost flat line in the graph suggests the pattern did not occur frequently. Figure 6.27 implies that for one participant activity level trend and vehicle commute trend did not show any changes between subsequent weeks.
