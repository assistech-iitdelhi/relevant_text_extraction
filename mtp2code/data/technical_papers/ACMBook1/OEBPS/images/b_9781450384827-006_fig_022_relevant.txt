Figure 6.22 shows two broad categories of data streams. The first category includes sensors that collect heterogeneous personal data such as accelerometers and GPS. These data streams are temporally aligned and divided into equal time windows Tw. Within each time window one or multiple probable life events and relevant attributes of these life events might be recognized. Life events signifies all daily living activities that are a part of daily life. Thus, we can effectively obtain a chronicle of the person’s life events called Personicle [Oh and Jain 2017, 2019].
Figure 6.22Chronicle of life events are derived from heterogeneous mobile multimedia content. Chronicle of environmental events are shown as segmented time series data. Each colored segment corresponds to a specific event.
Considering Figure 6.22, suppose we have M data streams DS1, DS2,…DSM, coming from heterogeneous sources of information. These data streams are divided into chunks of equal length called time window Ti . The information obtained from the sensors varies in many respects. Methods to convert data to information and the reliability of information could be entirely different for different sensors.
