Figure 6.5 demonstrates an initialized FSA corresponding to a pattern ρ1=(E5;ω[10] E1;ω[3] E4). During run time, Ei.ts and Ei.te are substituted with start and end time of an instance of event Ei from the input event stream. The strategy for counting occurrences of a pattern is straightforward.
Figure 6.5The automaton corresponding to pattern ρ1 with three event components. It demonstrates three ordinary states, two time states, and EVALUATE() and SET() functions associated with each state.
