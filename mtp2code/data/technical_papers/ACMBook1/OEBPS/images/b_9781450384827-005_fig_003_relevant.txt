Highlighting the rapidly growing interest in this problem, some recent papers focused on predicting readmission from EMR data. In 2015, the number of papers on hospital readmissions prediction approximately doubled compared to the previous year (Figure 5.3). The motivation behind the research efforts in using predictive analytics in healthcare is improving outcomes while reducing costs and avoiding reimbursement penalties for hospitals.
