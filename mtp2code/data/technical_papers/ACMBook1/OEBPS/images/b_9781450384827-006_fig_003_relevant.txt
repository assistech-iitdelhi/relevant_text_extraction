The paradigm of human-in-the-loop for model building is shown in a system architecture in Figure 6.3. Data-driven analysis results in the visualization of co-occurrence patterns Figure 6.3(a). By seeding a hypothesis based on the insight derived from such analysis, an expert can incorporate their own domain knowledge and formulate a refined hypothesis quickly, systematically, and grow the hypothesis iteratively to generate a comprehensive model [Figure 6.3(b)]. The former is called the unknown–unknown problem and the latter is called the known–unknown problem. The best model building practice is to create a balance between data-driven and hypothesis-driven analyses as one complements the other, reduces the search space significantly, and helps the analyst harvest and understand descriptive patterns.
