The simplest format for writing a formal context is a table with one row for each object and one column for each attribute. The crosses in the table highlights the relationship R between G and M, which means an object verifies an attribute. For example, Figure 6.24 represents a context in the form of a cross table. G (o1, o2, o3, o4, o5, o6, o7) is the object set and M(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9) is the attribute set.

We apply the NextClosure algorithm to build a comprehensive lattice from our pre-defined cross table (as shown in Figure 6.24) that captures the relationship between life events and their common attributes. Considering |L| = number of life events, and |A| = number of attributes, the time complexity of building the lattice is O(|L|2Ã—|A|).
