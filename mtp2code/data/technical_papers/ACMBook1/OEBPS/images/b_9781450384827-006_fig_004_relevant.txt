Figure 6.4 shows the building blocks of our FSA. Each operator in the language translates to its corresponding automaton to detect instances of a specific pattern in the input stream. The theory of FSA is rich and FSA techniques have been used in a wide range of domains such as pattern matching, pattern recognition, speech processing, handwriting recognition, encryption algorithm, and data compression. Using FSA for pattern recognition and pattern matching has several advantages.
