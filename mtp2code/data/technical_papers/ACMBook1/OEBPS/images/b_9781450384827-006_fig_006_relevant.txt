Selection (Ei.P): As shown in Figure 6.6, this operator filters pattern expression on predicate P, where P refers to event attributes contained in the pattern P ∈ ξ, and event schema ξ describes a set of attributes a class of events can contain. Ei, 1≤i≤N is an event type where Ei⊂Σ, and Σ is the alphabet of event types.
Figure 6.6Selection operator evaluates an ordinary state on event type Ei and and its attributes P. It can also select an event type Ei without any specific attribute.
