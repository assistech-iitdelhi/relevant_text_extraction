A promising approach for modeling complex phenomenon is to adopt a human-in-the-loop approach in the data processing step. This integrates high-level expert knowledge into the modeling process by acquiring an expertâ€™s relevance judgments regarding a set of initial retrieval results. Despite the apparent benefits of such a perspective, frameworks that facilitate a seamless interaction between a domain expert and a traditional knowledge discovery process are not well studied. Figure 4.1 shows the human-in-the-loop in a modeling process rooted in event mining.
