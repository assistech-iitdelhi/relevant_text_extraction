The most famous work in the formal study of purely interval-based temporal logic and reasoning in AI is by Allen [1981], who formalized temporal logic on intervals by specifying 13 interval relations and showing their completeness. Any two intervals are related by exactly one of the relations through operators (before, meets, overlaps, starts, during, finishes), corresponding inverses (after, met by, overlapped by, started by, contains, finished by), and equals (see Figure 3.3). Allen argued against using time points for event representation, stating instead that logical inconsistencies arise when events are allowed to have zero duration. This representation is not appropriate for modeling events from a cognitive perspective either. Hence, events have to have a certain duration in time and extend in space in order to be perceivable.
