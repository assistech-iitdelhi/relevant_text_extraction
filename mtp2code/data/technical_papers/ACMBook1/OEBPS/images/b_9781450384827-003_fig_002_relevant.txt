A comprehensive understanding of asthma risk factors requires building an explanatory model on event streams that facilitates studying the interrelations among multiple risk factors. Figure 3.2 shows a simplified example of three event streams: an activities of daily living (ADL) stream and two environmental streamsâ€”temperature and pollution.
Figure 3.2A toy example including three event streams. Each event is specified with a name and its timestamp(s). The ADL stream shows a person was in a meeting followed by a break. Start home and leave home are considered as point events. Asthma attack happened after starting exercise, while temperature was low and pollution was high in the surrounding environment.
