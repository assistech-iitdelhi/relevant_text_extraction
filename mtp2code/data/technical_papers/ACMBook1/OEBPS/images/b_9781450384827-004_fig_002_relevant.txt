Event models assign different properties to an event, and different observation sources help in our interpretation and modification of these event properties. For instance, an exercise event can have multiple properties such as heart rate, calorie consumption, speed, distance traveled, and number of floors climbed. Some of these properties can be recognized from motion sensors, and some can be recognized from physiological sensors. Figure 4.2 shows multiple data streams from various sources being stored in data silos and consumed by applications separately. However, using an effective event model helps fuse these data streams at the event level and creates multiple event streams. The properties of each event in the stream might be populated from disparate sensor measurements.
