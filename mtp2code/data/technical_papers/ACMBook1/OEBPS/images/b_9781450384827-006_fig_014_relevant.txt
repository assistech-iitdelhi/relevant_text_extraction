Figures 6.14 to 6.19 display six dominant risk factors based on their frequency counts in the city of Osaka. Significant risk factors are detected for each season separately because the risk factors are quite different from one season to another. RF1 shows that in summer, when solar radiation is high, the combination of low wind and high pollution causes asthma outbreaks. RF2 shows that without considering the effect of solar radiation, high wind and high pollution have a significant impact on asthma outbreaks. RF3 implies that low humidity in the presence of pollution plays an important role in outbreaks during spring, while temperature fluctuation is a major factor during the fall and winter. Also, a lack of wind while air pressure and humidity are high causes major outbreaks during winter.
