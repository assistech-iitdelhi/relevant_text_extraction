Figure 5.7Overall predictive maintenance workflow. Reproduced from Sipos et al. [2014].
Sipos et al. [2014] presented a data-driven approach, based on multiple-instance learning, for predicting equipment failures by mining equipment event logs, which contain rich operational information. The authors stated that the use of equipment logs to predict failures is complicated due to heterogeneous data that include symbolic and numeric time series, categorical variables, and unstructured text. Also, massive amounts of data pose computational challenges. The overall predictive maintenance workflow and a piece of a log file containing event information are represented in Figures 5.7 and 5.8, respectively.
