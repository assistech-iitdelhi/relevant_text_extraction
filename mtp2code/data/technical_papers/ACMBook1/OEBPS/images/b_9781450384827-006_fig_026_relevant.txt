The objective of this experiment is to find patterns of commute behavior from life events data. By generating sequential co-occurrence matrices with different temporal offsets, co-occurrences between leaving home, arriving home, and different commute events such as walking, vehicle commute, and cycling are studied. Figure 6.26 demonstrates the results for three different users. Figure 6.26(a) indicates commute pattern LeavingHome→[15mins]VehicleCommute with a confidence value of 0.87, which means with 87% probability the user drove a vehicle within 15 minutes after leaving home. By increasing the temporal offset to one hour, the probability reaches 98%. Leaving home followed by cycling, and cycling followed by attending a class are commute patterns observable for another user in Figures 6.26(b) and 6.26(c). Finally, Figure 6.26(d) shows walking commute behavior to/from school for the third user.
