<h2 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57" style="text-align: center;">Work and Energy</h2>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">In the previous few chapters we have talked about ways of describing the motion of objects, the cause of motion and gravitation. Another concept that helps us understand and interpret many natural phenomena is ‘work’. Closely related to work are energy and power. In this chapter we shall study these concepts.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">All living beings need food. Living beings have to perform several basic activities to survive. We call such activities ‘life processes’. The energy for these processes comes from food. We need energy for other activities like playing, singing, reading, writing, thinking, jumping, cycling and running. Activities that are strenuous require more energy.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Animals too get engaged in activities. For example, they may jump and run. They have to fight, move away from enemies, find food or find a safe place to live. Also, we engage some animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull carts or plough fields. All such activities require energy.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Think of machines. List the machines that you have come across. What do they need for their working? Why do some engines require fuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living beings and machines need energy?</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57"><br/></p>
<h4 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">11.1<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Work</h4>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">What is work? There is a difference in the way we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life and the way we use it in science. To make this point clear let us consider a few examples.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57"><br/></p>
<h5 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">11.1.1<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Not much ‘work’ in spite of working hard!</h5>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Kamali is preparing for examinations. She spends lot of time in studies. She reads books, draws diagrams, organises her thoughts, collects question papers, attends classes, discusses problems with her friends, and performs experiments. She expends a lot of energy on these activities. In common parlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard work’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by the scientific definition of work.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">You are working hard to push a huge rock. Let us say the rock does not move despite all the effort. You get completely exhausted. However, you have not done any work on the rock as there is no displacement of the rock.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">You stand still for a few minutes with a heavy load on your head. You get tired. You have exerted yourself and have spent quite a bit of your energy. Are you doing work on the load? The way we understand the term ‘work’ in science, work is not done.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">You climb up the steps of a staircase and reach the second floor of a building just to see the landscape from there. You may even climb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific definition, these activities involve a lot of work.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">In day-to-day life, we consider any useful physical or mental labour as work. Activities like playing in a field, talking with friends, humming a tune, watching a movie, attending a function are sometimes not considered to be work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends on the way we define it. We use and define the term work differently in science. To understand this let us do the following activities:</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">•<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>We have discussed in the above paragraphs a number of activities which we normally consider to be work in day-to-day life. For each of these activities, ask the following questions and answer them:</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">To understand the way we view work and define work from the point of view of science, let us consider some situations:</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Push a pebble lying on a surface. The pebble moves through a distance. You exerted a force on the pebble and the pebble got displaced. In this situation work is done.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">A girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves through a distance. The girl has exerted a force on the trolley and it is displaced. Therefore, work is done.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Lift a book through a height. To do this you must apply a force. The book rises up. There is a force applied on the book and the book has moved. Hence, work is done.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">A closer look at the above situations reveals that two conditions need to be satisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should act on an object, and (ii) the object must be displaced.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">If any one of the above conditions does not exist, work is not done. This is the way we view work in science.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">A bullock is pulling a cart. The cart moves. There is a force on the cart and the cart has moved. Do you think that work is done in this situation?</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">How is work defined in science? To understand this, we shall first consider the case when the force is acting in the direction of displacement.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Let a constant force, F act on an object. Let the object be displaced through a distance, s in the direction of the force (Fig. 11.1). Let W be the work done. We define work to be equal to the product of the force and displacement.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Work done<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>=<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>force × displacement</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">W<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>=<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>F s<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span> (11.1)</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57"><img alt="694" src="../Images/694.png"/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57" style="text-align: center;"><b>Fig. 11.1</b></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Thus, work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force. Work has only magnitude and no direction.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">In Eq. (11.1), if F = 1 N and s = 1 m then the work done by the force will be 1 N m. Here the unit of work is newton metre (N m) or joule (J). Thus 1 J is the amount of work done on an object when a force of 1 N displaces it by 1 m along the line of action of the force.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Look at Eq. (11.1) carefully. What is the work done when the force on the object is zero? What would be the work done when the displacement of the object is zero? Refer to the conditions that are to be satisfied to say that work is done.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57"><br/></p>
<div class="border">
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57"><b>&#160;Example 11.1</b> A force of 5 N is acting on an&#160;object. The object is displaced through 2 m in the direction of the force (Fig. 11.2). If the force acts on the object all through the displacement, then work done is 5 N × 2 m =10 N m or 10 J.</p>

In such situations, the work done by the force is taken as positive.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Consider a situation in which an object is moving with a uniform velocity along a particular direction. Now a retarding force, F, is applied in the opposite direction. That is, the angle between the two directions is 180º. Let the object stop after a displacement s.

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">F × (–s) or (–F × s).</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Life is impossible without energy. The demand for energy is ever increasing. Where do we get energy from? The Sun is the biggest natural source of energy to us. Many of our energy sources are derived from the Sun. We can also get energy from the nuclei of atoms, the interior of the earth, and the tides. Can you think of other sources of energy?</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57"><br/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">The word energy is very often used in our daily life, but in science we give it a definite and precise meaning. Let us consider the following examples: when a fast moving cricket ball hits a stationary wicket, the wicket is thrown away. Similarly, an object when raised to a certain height gets the capability to do work. You must have seen that when a raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece of wood, it drives the nail into the wood. We have also observed children winding a toy (such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed on the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon is filled with air and we press it we notice a change in its shape. As long as we press it gently, it can come back to its original shape when the force is withdrawn. However, if we press the balloon hard, it can even explode producing a blasting sound. In all these examples, the objects acquire, through different means, the capability of doing work. An object having a capability to do work is said to possess energy. The object which does the work loses energy and the object on which the work is done gains energy.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">How does an object with energy do work? An object that possesses energy can exert a force on another object. When this happens, energy is transferred from the former to the latter. The second object may move as it receives energy and therefore do some work. Thus, the first object had a capacity to do work. This implies that any object that possesses energy can do work.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">The energy possessed by an object is thus measured in terms of its capacity of doing work. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same as that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the energy required to do 1 joule of work. Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Luckily the world we live in provides energy in many different forms. The various forms include mechanical energy (potential energy&#160;+ kinetic energy), heat energy, chemical energy, electrical energy and light energy.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">A moving object can do work. An object moving faster can do more work than an identical object moving relatively slow. A moving bullet, blowing wind, a rotating wheel, a speeding stone can do work. How does a bullet pierce the target? How does the wind move the blades of a windmill? Objects in motion possess energy. We call this energy kinetic energy.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">A falling coconut, a speeding car, a rolling stone, a flying aircraft, flowing water, blowing wind, a running athlete etc. possess kinetic energy. In short, kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">How much energy is possessed by a moving body by virtue of its motion? By definition, we say that the kinetic energy of a body moving with a certain velocity is equal to the work done on it to make it acquire that velocity.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Let us now express the kinetic energy of an object in the form of an equation. Consider an object of mass, m moving with a uniform velocity, u. Let it now be displaced through a distance s when a constant force, F acts on it in the direction of its displacement. From Eq. (11.1), the work done, W is F s. The work done on the object will cause a change in its velocity. Let its velocity change from u to v. Let a be the acceleration produced.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">In section 8.5, we studied three equations of motion. The relation connecting the initial velocity (u) and final velocity (v) of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a, and the displacement, s is</p>

<h5 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">11.2.6<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Law of conservation of energy</h5>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">In activities 11.13 and 11.14, we learnt that the form of energy can be changed from one form to another. What happens to the total energy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total energy remains unchanged. This is the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid in all situations and for all kinds of transformations.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Consider a simple example. Let an object of mass, m be made to fall freely from a height, h. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and kinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic energy zero? It is zero because its velocity is zero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh. As it falls, its potential energy will change into kinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object at a given instant, the kinetic energy would be ½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the potential energy would decrease while the kinetic energy would increase. When the object is about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy would be the largest and potential energy the least. However, the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy of the object would be the same at all points. That is,</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">potential energy + kinetic energy = constant</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">or</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">mgh +&#160;½ mv<sup>2 </sup>= constant (11.7)</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">We find that during the free fall of the object, the decrease in potential energy, at any point in its path, appears as an equal amount of increase in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of air resistance on the motion of the object has been ignored.) There is thus a continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">A stronger person may do certain work in relatively less time. A more powerful vehicle would complete a journey in a shorter time than a less powerful one. We talk of the power of machines like motorbikes and motorcars. The speed with which these vehicles change energy or do work is a basis for their classification. Power measures the speed of work done, that is, how fast or slow work is done. Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy. If an agent does a work W in time t, then power is given by:</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">Power = work/time</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">or &#160;P = W/t</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">The unit of power is watt [in honour of James Watt (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol W. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which does work at the rate of 1 joule per second. We can also say that power is 1 W when the rate of consumption of energy is 1 J s<sup>–1</sup>.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s<sup>–1</sup>.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-57">The power of an agent may vary with time. This means that the agent may be doing work at different rates at different intervals of time.
