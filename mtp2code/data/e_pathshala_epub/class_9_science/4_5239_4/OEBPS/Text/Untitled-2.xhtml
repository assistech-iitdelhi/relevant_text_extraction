<h2 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB" style="text-align: center;">Structure of the Atom</h2>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">In Chapter 3, we have learnt that atoms and molecules are the fundamental building blocks of matter. The existence of different kinds of matter is due to different atoms constituting them. Now the questions arise: (i) What makes the atom of one element different from the atom of another element? and (ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as proposed by Dalton, or are there smaller constituents inside the atom? We shall find out the answers to these questions in this chapter. We will learn about sub-atomic particles and the various models that have been proposed to explain how these particles are arranged within the atom.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">A major challenge before the scientists at the end of the 19th century was to reveal the structure of the atom as well as to explain its important properties. The elucidation of the structure of atoms is based on a series of experiments.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">One of the first indications that atoms are not indivisible, comes from studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted by different substances.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">For understanding the nature of charged particles in matter, let us carry out the following activities:</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></p>
<div class="border-box">

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">From these activities, can we conclude that on rubbing two objects together, they become electrically charged? Where does this charge come from? This question can be answered by knowing that an atom is divisible and consists of charged particles.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">It was known by 1900 that the atom was indivisible particle but contained at least one sub-atomic particle – the electron identified by J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations in a gas discharge and called them canal rays. These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another sub-atomic particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron. Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron. It was given the name of proton. In general, an electron is represented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">It seemed that an atom was composed of protons and electrons, mutually balancing their charges. It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom, for whereas electrons could easily be removed off but&#160;not protons. Now the big question was:&#160;</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">what sort of structure did these particles of the atom form? We will find the answer to&#160;this question below.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">We have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory in Chapter 3, which suggested that the atom was indivisible and indestructible. But the discovery of two fundamental particles (electrons and protons) inside the atom, led to the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom. For explaining this, many scientists proposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a model for the structure of an atom.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB"><br/></p>
<h5 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">4.2.1<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Thomson’s model of an atom</h5>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We can also think of a watermelon, the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon, while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere, like the seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms are electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model, as we will see below.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">E. Rutherford (1871-1937) was born at Spring Grove on 30 August 1871. He was known as the ‘Father’ of nuclear physics. He is famous for his work on radioactivity and the discovery of the nucleus of an atom with the gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1908.</p>
</div>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Let us think of an activity in an open field to understand the implications of this experiment. Let</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">a child stand in front of a wall with his eyes closed. Let him throw stones at the wall from a distance. He will hear a sound when each stone strikes the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford concluded from the α-particle scattering experiment that–</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">(i)<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">(ii)<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span>Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">On the basis of his experiment, Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following features:</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration. During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know. We know that atoms are quite stable.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">We have learnt how the electrons in an atom are arranged in different shells/orbits. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as the valence electrons.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">From the Bohr-Bury scheme, we also know that the outermost shell of an atom can accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It was observed that the atoms of elements, completely filled with 8 electrons in the outermost shell show little chemical activity. In other words, their combining capacity or valency is zero. Of these inert elements, the helium atom has two electrons in its outermost shell and all other elements have atoms with eight electrons in the outermost shell.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">The combining capacity of the atoms of elements, that is, their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements, was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell. An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons was said to possess an octet. Atoms would thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell. This was done by sharing, gaining or losing electrons. The number of electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell, gives us directly the combining capacity of the element, that is, the valency discussed in the previous chapter. For example, hydrogen/lithium/sodium atoms contain one electron each in their outermost shell, therefore each one of them can lose one electron. So, they are said to have valency of one. Can you tell, what is valency of magnesium and aluminium? It is two and three, respectively, because magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has three electrons in its outermost shell.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">If the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is close to its full capacity, then valency is determined in a different way. For example, the fluorine atom has 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its valency could be 7. But it is easier for&#160;fluorine to gain one electron instead of losing seven electrons. Hence, its valency is determined by subtracting seven electrons from the octet and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine. Valency can be calculated in a similar manner for oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that you get from this calculation?</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Therefore, an atom of each element has a definite combining capacity, called its valency. Valency of the first eighteen elements is given in the last column of Table 4.1.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number of protons of an atom, which determines its atomic number. It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms of an element have the same atomic number, Z. In fact, elements are defined by the number of protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1, because in hydrogen atom, only one proton is present in the nucleus. Similarly, for carbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number is defined as the total number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">After studying the properties of the sub-atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude that mass of an atom is practically due to protons and neutrons alone. These are present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence protons and neutrons are also called nucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of carbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14 neutrons). The mass number is defined as the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It is denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom, the atomic number, mass number and symbol of the element are to be written as:</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">In nature, a number of atoms of some elements have been identified, which have the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, take the case of hydrogen atom, it has three atomic species, namely protium (<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>H), deuterium (<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>H or D) and tritium (<sub>1</sub><sup>3</sup>H or T). The atomic number of each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Other such examples are (i) carbon, <sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub>C and <sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub>C, (ii) chlorine, <sup>35</sup><sub>17</sub>Cl and <sup>37</sup><sub>17</sub>Cl, etc.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">On the basis of these examples, isotopes are defined as the atoms of the same element, having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Therefore, we can say that there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom, namely protium, deuterium and tritium.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Many elements consist of a mixture of isotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure substance. The chemical properties of isotopes are similar but their physical properties are different.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic forms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio of 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what should we take as the mass of chlorine atom? Let us find out.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">The average atomic mass of chlorine atom, on the basis of above data, will be</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB"><img alt="f2" src="../Images/f2.PNG"/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">The mass of an atom of any natural element is taken as the average mass of all the naturally occuring atoms of that element. If an element has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom would be the same as the sum of protons and neutrons in it. But if an element occurs in isotopic forms, then we have to know the percentage of each isotopic form and then the average mass is calculated.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-22" xml:lang="en-GB">This does not mean that any one atom of chlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It means that if you take a certain amount of chlorine, it will contain both isotopes of chlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.</p>
