<h2 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38" style="text-align: center;">Gravitation</h2>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><br/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">In Chapters 8 and 9, we have learnt about the motion of objects and force as the cause of motion. We have learnt that a force is needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of an object. We always observe that an object dropped from a height falls towards the earth. We know that all the planets go around the Sun. The moon goes around the earth. In all these cases, there must be some force acting on the objects, the planets and on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp that the same force is responsible for all these. This force is called the gravitational force.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">In this chapter we shall learn about gravitation and the universal law of gravitation. We shall discuss the motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force on the earth. We shall study how the weight of a body varies from place to place. We shall also discuss the conditions for objects to float in liquids.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We know that the moon goes around the earth. An object when thrown upwards, reaches a certain height and then falls downwards. It is said that when Newton was sitting under a tree, an apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made Newton start thinking. He thought that: if the earth can attract an apple, can it not attract the moon? Is the force the same in both cases? He conjectured that the same type of force is responsible in both the cases. He argued that at each point of its orbit, the moon falls towards the earth, instead of going off in a straight line. So, it must be attracted by the earth. But we do not really see the moon falling towards the earth.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Let us try to understand the motion of the moon by recalling activity 8.11.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Before the thread is released, the stone moves in a circular path with a certain speed and changes direction at every point. The change in direction involves change in velocity or acceleration. The force that causes this acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path is acting towards the centre. This force is called the centripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force. In the absence of this force, the stone flies off along a straight line. This straight line will be a tangent to the circular path.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The motion of the moon around the earth is due to the centripetal force. The centripetal force is provided by the force of attraction of the earth. If there were no such force, the moon would pursue a uniform straight line motion.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">It is seen that a falling apple is attracted towards the earth. Does the apple attract the earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving towards an apple. Why?</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">According to the third law of motion, the apple does attract the earth. But according to the second law of motion, for a given force, acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object [Eq. (9.4)]. The mass of an apple is negligibly small compared to that of the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving towards the apple. Extend the same argument for why the earth does not move towards the moon.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">In our solar system, all the planets go around the Sun. By arguing the same way, we can say that there exists a force between the Sun and the planets. From the above facts Newton concluded that not only does the earth attract an apple and the moon, but all objects in the universe attract each other. This force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational force.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38" style="text-align: center;"><b>Isaac Newton</b></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38" style="text-align: center;"><b>(1642 – 1727)</b></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Isaac Newton was born in Woolsthorpe near Grantham, England. He is generally regarded as the most original and influential theorist in the history of science. He was born in a poor farming family. But he was not good at farming. He was sent to study at Cambridge University in 1661. In 1665 a plague broke out in Cambridge and so Newton took a year off. It was during this year that the incident of the apple falling on him is said to have occurred. This incident prompted Newton to explore the possibility of connecting gravity with the force that kept the moon in its orbit. This led him to the universal law of gravitation. It is remarkable that many great scientists before him knew of gravity but failed to realise it.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Newton formulated the well-known laws of motion. He worked on theories of light and colour. He designed an astronomical telescope to carry out astronomical observations. Newton was also a great mathematician. He invented a new branch of mathematics, called calculus. He used it to prove that for objects outside a sphere of uniform density, the sphere behaves as if the whole of its mass is concentrated at its centre. Newton transformed the structure of physical science with his three laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation. As the keystone of the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, Newton’s work combined the contributions of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and others into a new powerful synthesis.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">It is remarkable that though the gravitational theory could not be verified at that time, there was hardly any doubt about its correctness. This is because Newton based his theory on sound scientific reasoning and backed it with mathematics. This made the theory simple and elegant. These qualities are now recognised as essential requirements of a good scientific theory.</p>

<h5 class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38" style="text-align: center;">How did Newton guess the&#160;inverse-square rule?</h5>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">There has always been a great interest in the motion of planets. By the 16th century, a lot of data on the motion of planets had been collected by many astronomers. Based on these data Johannes Kepler derived three laws, which govern the motion of planets. These are called Kepler’s laws. These are:</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">1.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span>The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci, as shown in the figure given below. In this figure O is the position of the Sun.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span>The line joining the planet and the Sun sweep equal areas in equal intervals of time. Thus, if the time of travel from A to B is the same as that from C to D, then the areas OAB and OCD are equal.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;">	</span>The cube of the mean distance of a planet from the Sun is proportional to the square of its orbital period T. Or, r<sup>3</sup>/T<sup>2</sup>&#160;= constant.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><img alt="d5" src="../Images/d5.PNG"/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">It is important to note that Kepler could not give a theory to explain the motion of planets. It was Newton who showed that the cause of the planetary motion is the gravitational&#160;force that the Sun exerts on them. Newton used the third law of Kepler to calculate the gravitational force of attraction. The gravitational force of the earth is weakened by distance. A simple argument goes like this. We can assume that the planetary orbits are circular. Suppose the orbital velocity is v and the radius of the orbit is r. Then the force acting on an orbiting planet is given by F<!--StartFragment-->∝v2/r.<br/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">If T denotes the period, then v = 2πr/T, so that v<sup>2</sup>∝<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">&#160;r2/T2.</span></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We can rewrite this as v<sup>2</sup>&#160;∝(1/r) × ( r3/T2).<br/>&#160;Since r<sup>3</sup>/T<sup>2</sup>&#160;is constant by Kepler’s third law, we have v<sup>2</sup>&#160;∝&#160;1/r.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">&#160;Combining this with F&#160;∝&#160;v<sup>2</sup>/ r,</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We have learnt that the earth attracts objects towards it. This is due to the gravitational force. Whenever objects fall towards the earth under this force alone, we say that the objects are in free fall. Is there any change in the velocity of falling objects? While falling, there is no change in the direction of motion of the objects. But due to the earth’s attraction, there will be a change in the magnitude of the velocity. Any change in velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an object falls towards the earth, an acceleration is involved. This acceleration is due to the earth’s gravitational force. Therefore, this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth (or acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by g. The unit of g is the same as that of acceleration, that is, m s<sup>–2</sup>.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We know from the second law of motion that force is the product of mass and acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in activity 10.2 be m. We already know that there is acceleration involved in falling objects due to the gravitational force and is denoted by g. Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational force F will be equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to the gravitational force, that is,</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The earth is not a perfect sphere. As the radius of the earth increases from the poles to the equator, the value of g becomes greater at the poles than at the equator. For most calculations, we can take g to be more or less constant on or near the earth. But for objects far from the earth, the acceleration due to gravitational force of earth is given by Eq.

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We have learnt in the previous chapter that the mass of an object is the measure of its inertia (section 9.3). We have also learnt that greater the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains the same whether the object is on the earth, the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an object is constant and does not change from place to place.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We know that the earth attracts every object with a certain force and this force depends on the mass (m) of the object and the acceleration due to the gravity (g). The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We know that</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">As the weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, that is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We have learnt that the value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass, say m, of the object, that is, W 1490.png m. It is due to this reason that at a given place, we can use the weight of an object as a measure of its mass. The mass of an object remains the same everywhere, that is, on the earth and on any planet whereas its weight depends on its location because g depends on location.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Have you ever wondered why a camel can run in a desert easily? Why an army tank weighing more than a thousand tonne rests upon a continuous chain? Why a truck or a motorbus has much wider tyres? Why cutting tools have sharp edges? In order to address these questions and understand the phenomena involved, it helps to introduce the concepts of the net force in a particular direction (thrust) and the force per unit area (pressure) acting on the object concerned.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Let us try to understand the meanings of thrust and pressure by considering the following situations:</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><b>Situation 1:</b> You wish to fix a poster on a&#160;bulletin board, as shown in Fig 10.3. To do&#160;this task you will have to press drawing pins&#160;with your thumb. You apply a force on the&#160;surface area of the head of the pin. This force&#160;is directed perpendicular to the surface area&#160;of the board. This force acts on a smaller area&#160;at the tip of the pin.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><img alt="1175" src="../Images/1175.png"/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38" style="text-align: center;"><b>Fig. 10.3: To fix a poster, drawing pins are pressed&#160;with the thumb perpendicular to the board.</b></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><b>Situation 2:</b> You stand on loose sand. Your feet go deep into the sand. Now, lie down on the sand. You will find that your body will not go that deep in the sand. In both cases the force exerted on the sand is the weight of your body.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">You have learnt that weight is the force acting vertically downwards. Here the force is acting perpendicular to the surface of the sand. The force acting on an object perpendicular to the surface is called thrust.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">When you stand on loose sand, the force, that is, the weight of your body is acting on an area equal to area of your feet. When you lie down, the same force acts on an area equal to the contact area of your whole body, which is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different. In the above cases, thrust is the same. But effects are different. Therefore the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The effect of thrust on sand is larger while standing than while lying. The thrust on unit area is called pressure. Thus,</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><br/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in the downward direction. So the bottle is pulled downwards. But the water exerts an upward force on the bottle. Thus, the bottle is pushed upwards. We have learnt that weight of an object is the force due to gravitational attraction of the earth. When the bottle is immersed, the upward force exerted by the water on the bottle is greater than its weight. Therefore it rises up when released.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">To keep the bottle completely immersed, the upward force on the bottle due to water must be balanced. This can be achieved by an externally applied force acting downwards. This force must at least be equal to the difference between the upward force and the weight of the bottle.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The upward force exerted by the water on the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant force. In fact, all objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid. The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The nail sinks. The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth on the iron nail pulls it downwards. There is an upthrust of water on the nail, which pushes it upwards. But the downward force acting on the nail is greater than the upthrust of water on the nail. So it sinks (Fig. 10.5).</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38"><br/></p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The cork floats while the nail sinks. This happens because of the difference in their densities. The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume. The density of cork is less than the density of water. This means that the upthrust of water on the cork is greater than the weight of the cork. So it floats (Fig. 10.5).</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">The density of an iron nail is more than the density of water. This means that the upthrust of water on the iron nail is less than the weight of the nail. So it sinks.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Therefore objects of density less than that of a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of density greater than that of a liquid sink in the liquid.</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">You will find that the elongation of the string or the reading of the balance decreases as the stone is gradually lowered in the water. However, no further change is observed once the stone gets fully immersed in the water. What do you infer from the decrease in the extension of the string or the reading of the spring balance?</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">We know that the elongation produced in the string or the spring balance is due to the weight of the stone. Since the extension decreases once the stone is lowered in water, it means that some force acts on the stone in upward direction. As a result, the net force on the string decreases and hence the elongation also decreases. As discussed earlier, this upward force exerted by water is known as the force of buoyancy.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">What is the magnitude of the buoyant&#160;force experienced by a body? Is it the same in all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies&#160;in a given fluid experience the same buoyant force? The answer to these questions is contained in Archimedes’ principle, stated as follows:</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">When a body is immersed fully or partially in a fluid, it experiences an upward force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">Now, can you explain why a further decrease in the elongation of the string was not observed in activity 10.7, as the stone was fully immersed in water?</p>

<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">As you know, the density of a substance is defined as mass of a unit volume. The unit of density is kilogram per metre cube (kg m–3). The density of a given substance, under specified conditions, remains the same. Therefore the density of a substance is one of its characteristic properties. It is different for different substances. For example, the density of gold is 19300 kg m-3 while that of water is 1000 kg m-3. The density of a given sample of a substance can help us to determine its purity.</p>
<p class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-38">It is often convenient to express density of a substance in comparison with that of water. The relative density of a substance is the ratio of its density to that of water:</p>
