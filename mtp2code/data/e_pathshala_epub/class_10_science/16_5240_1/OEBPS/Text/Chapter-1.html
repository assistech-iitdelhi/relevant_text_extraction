    <p>Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens when –</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>milk is left at room temperature during summers.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>grapes get fermented.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>food is cooked.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>food gets digested in our body.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>we respire.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.</p>

    <p>You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to these questions.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

      <p><span class="pink_text">CAUTION:</span> This Activity needs the teacher's assistance. It would be better if students wear suitable eyeglasses.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Clean a magnesium ribbon about 3-4 cm long by rubbing it with sandpaper.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Hold it with a pair of tongs. Burn it using a spirit lamp or burner and collect the ash so formed in a watch-glass as shown in Fig. 1.1. Burn the magnesium ribbon keeping it as far as possible from your eyes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>What do you observe?</p>

  <p class="activity"></p>

  <p>From the above three activities, we can say that any of the following observations helps us to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place –</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>change in state</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>change in colour</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>evolution of a gas</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>change in temperature.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>As we observe the changes around us, we can see that there is a large variety of chemical reactions taking place around us. We will study about the various types of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation in this Chapter.</p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p class="ConceptHeading"><b>1.1 Chemical Equations</b></p>

  <p>Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a word-equation.</p>

  <p>The word-equation for the above reaction would be –</p>

  <p class="activity" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="3112" src="../Images/3112.JPG"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1), magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.</p>

  <p>A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand side (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of the reaction.</p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p class="SubHeading"><b>1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation</b></p>

  <p>Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">Mg + O<sub>2</sub> → MgO (1.2)</p>

  <p>Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not, then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air.</p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p class="SubHeading"><b>1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations</b></p>

  <p>Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.</p>

  <p>In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.</p>

  <p>The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen</p>

  <p>The above word-equation may be represented by the following chemical equation –</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">Zn + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> → ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> (1.3)</p>

  <p>Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both sides of the arrow.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="t1" src="../Images/t1.png" style="width:70%"/></div>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.</p>

  <p>Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">Fe + H<sub>2</sub>O → Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> (1.4)</p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step I:</b></span> To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the equation.</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="e1" src="../Images/e1.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

  <p class="activity1"></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><br/></span></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step II:</b></span> List the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation (1.5).</p>

  <p><img alt="t2" src="../Images/t2.png" style="width:70%"/></p>

  <div class="image"></div>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b><br/></b></span></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step III:</b></span> It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and the element oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS.</p>

  <p>To balance the oxygen atoms –</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="t3" src="../Images/t3.png" style="width:70%"/></div>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient ‘4’ as 4 H<sub>2</sub>O and not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>. Now the partly balanced equation becomes–</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="e2" src="../Images/e2.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><br/></span></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step IV:</b></span> Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced equation.</p>

  <p>To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules of hydrogen as four on the RHS.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="t4" src="../Images/t4.png" style="width:70%"/></div>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p style="text-align: left;">The equation would be –</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="e3" src="../Images/e3.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><br/></span></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step V:</b></span> Examine the above equation and pick up the third element which is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be balanced, that is, iron.</p>

  <p><img alt="t5" src="../Images/t5.png" style="width:70%"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.</p>

  <div class="image"><img alt="e4" src="../Images/e4.png" style="width:100%"/></div>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><br/></span></p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step VI:</b></span> Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="e5" src="../Images/e5.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.</p>

  <p><span class="pink_text"><b>Step VII:</b></span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Writing Symbols of Physical States</span> Carefully examine the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has been given in this equation about their physical states.</p>

  <p>To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s), respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product is present as a solution in water.</p>

  <p>The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">3Fe(s) + 4H<sub>2</sub>O(g) → Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(s) + 4H<sub>2</sub>(g) (1.10)</p>

  <p>Note that the symbol (g) is used with H<sub>2</sub>O to indicate that in this reaction water is used in the form of steam.</p>

  <p>Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless it is necessary to specify them.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow in the equation. For example –</p>

  <p><img alt="e6" src="../Images/e6.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>Using these steps, can you balance Eq. (1.2) given in the text earlier?</p>

  <p class="ConceptHeading"><b>1.2 Types of Chemical Reactions</b></p>

  <p class="chapterText"></p>

  <p>We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="108" src="../Images/108.PNG"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.</p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <div class="lining_boxo">
  <p class="orange_text" style="text-align: center;"><strong>DO YOU KNOW</strong>?</p>

  <p>A solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for white washing walls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin layer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is formed after two to three days of white washing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note that the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

  <p class="activity1"></p>
<img alt="e8" src="../Images/e8.png" style="width:100%"/></div>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>Let us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.</p>

  <p>(i) Burning of coal</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">C(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO<sub>2</sub>(g) (1.15)</p>

  <p>(ii) Formation of water from H<sub>2</sub>(g) and O<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l) (1.16)</p>

  <p class="activity1"></p>

  <p>In simple language we can say that when two or more substances (elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions are called combination reactions.</p>

  <p>In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved. This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is released along with the formation of products are called exothermic chemical reactions.</p>

  <p>Other examples of exothermic reactions are –</p>

  <p>(i) Burning of natural gas</p>

  <p class="activity1" style="text-align: center;">CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + 2O<sub>2</sub> (g) → CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (g) (1.17)</p>

  <p>(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?</p>

  <p>We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of which you will study in Chapter 6.</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="e9" src="../Images/e9.png" style="width:100%"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an example of an exothermic reaction.</p>

  <p>Identify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where heat is given out along with the formation of a single product.</p>

    <p>Have you noticed that the green colour of the ferrous sulphate crystals has changed? You can also smell the characteristic odour of burning sulphur.</p>

    <p class="activity1"><img alt="e10" src="../Images/e10.png" style="width:100%"/><br/></p>

    <p class="activity1"></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p>In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous sulphate crystals (FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 7H<sub>2</sub>O) lose water when heated and the colour of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and sulphur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>). Ferric oxide is a solid, while SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> are gases.</p>

    <p>Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has many uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.</p>

  <p>The surface of copper powder becomes coated with black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black substance formed?</p>

  <p>This is because oxygen is added to copper and copper oxide is formed.</p>

  <p class="activity1"><img alt="d" src="../Images/d.png" style="text-align: center; width: 100%;"/></p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place and copper is obtained.</p>

  <p><br/></p>

  <p>If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised. If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.</p>

  <p>During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised. In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions or redox reactions.</p>

  <p>From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.</p>

  <p>You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating formed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this process is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green coating on copper are other examples of corrosion.</p>

  <p>Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in Chapter 3.</p>

  <p>When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised ?</p>
