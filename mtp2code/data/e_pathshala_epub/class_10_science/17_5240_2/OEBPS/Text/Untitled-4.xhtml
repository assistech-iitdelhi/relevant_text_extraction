    </ul>

    <p class="body">You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.</p>

    <p class="body">In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.</p>

      <p>Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.<b><br/></b></p>

    <p class="ConceptHeading">2.3 How strong are acid or base solutions?</p>

    <p class="bodytext-1st-para">We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about dilution and decrease in concentration of H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>–</sup> ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?</p>

    <p class="body">We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.</p>

    <p class="body">A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘<span class="char-style-override-6">potenz</span>’ in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline).</p>

    <p class="body">pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher the hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.</p>

    <p class="body">The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in OH<sup>–</sup> ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.</p>

Tooth enamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium phosphate) is the hardest substance in the body.

Bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent this is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="body">Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of crystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the salt turns white.</p>
<p class="body">If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue colour of the crystals reappears.</p>
<p class="body">Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper sulphate is Cu SO<sub><sub>4</sub></sub>. 5H<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O. Now you would be able to answer the question whether the molecule of Na<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>CO<sub><sub>3</sub></sub>.10H<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O is wet.</p>

    <p class="body">One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum. It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical formula CaSO<sub><sub>4</sub></sub>.2H<sub><sub>2</sub></sub>O. Let us look into the use of this salt.</p>

    <p class="body">Note that only half a water molecule is shown to be attached as water of crystallisation. How can you get half a water molecule? It is written in this form because two formula units of CaSO<sub>4</sub> share one molecule of water. Plaster of Paris is used for making toys, materials for decoration and for making surfaces smooth. Try to find out why is calcium sulphate hemihydrate called ‘Plaster of Paris’ ?</p>
