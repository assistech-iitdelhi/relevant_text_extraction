			<div class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-1"><span class="char-style-override-1">Biology is the study of living organisms. The detailed description of their form and appearance only brought out their diversity. It is the cell theory that emphasised the unity underlying this diversity of forms, i.e., the cellular organisation of all life forms. A description of cell structure and cell growth by division is given in the chapters comprising this unit. Cell theory also created a sense of mystery around living phenomena, i.e., physiological and behavioural processes. This mystery was the requirement of integrity of cellular organisation for living phenomena to be demonstrated or observed. In studying and understanding the physiological and behavioural processes, one can take a physico-chemical approach and use cell-free systems to investigate. This approach enables us to describe the various processes in molecular terms. The approach is established by analysis of living tissues for elements and compounds. It will tell us what types of organic compounds are present in living organisms. In the next stage, one can ask the question: What are these compounds doing inside a cell? And, in what way they carry out gross physiological processes like digestion, excretion, memory, defense, recognition, etc. In other words we answer the question, what is the molecular basis of all physiological processes? It can also explain the abnormal processes that occur during any diseased condition. This physico-chemical approach to study and understand living organisms is called ‘Reductionist Biology’. The concepts and techniques of physics </span><span class="char-style-override-4">and chemistry are applied to understand biology. In Chapter </span><span class="char-style-override-4">9</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> of this unit, a brief description of biomolecules is provided.</span></div>

<div class="text">When you look around, you see both living and non-living things. You must have wondered and asked yourself – ‘what is it that makes an organism living, or what is it that an inanimate thing does not have which a living thing has’ ? The answer to this is the presence of the basic unit of life – the cell in all living organisms.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">All organisms are composed of cells. Some are composed of a single cell and are called unicellular organisms while others, like us, composed of many cells, are called multicellular organisms.</div>
<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-11"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.1	What is a Cell?</span></h3>
			<div class="text">Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and<br/>(ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete structure of a cell does not ensure independent living. Hence, cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. </div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Anton Von Leeuwenhoek first saw and described a live cell. Robert Brown later discovered the nucleus. The invention of the microscope and its improvement leading to the electron microscope revealed all the structural details of the cell.</span></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-11"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.2	Cell Theory</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>In 1838, Ma</span>tthias Schleiden, a German botanist, examined a large number of plants and observed that all plants are composed of different kinds of cells which form the tissues of the plant. At about the same time, Theodore Schwann (1839), a British Zoologist, studied different types of animal cells and reported that cells had a thin outer layer which is today known as the ‘plasma membrane’. He also concluded, based on his studies on plant tissues, that the presence of cell wall is a unique character of the plant cells. On the basis of this, Schwann proposed the hypothesis that the bodies of animals and plants are composed of cells and products of cells.</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Schleiden and Schwann together formulated the cell theory. This theory however, did not explain as to how new cells were formed. Rudolf Virchow (1855) first explained that cells divided and new cells are formed from pre-existing cells (</span><span class="char-style-override-13">Omnis cellula-e cellula</span><span>). He modified the hypothesis of Schleiden and Schwann to give the cell theory a final shape. Cell theory as understood today is:</span></div>
			<div class="indent">(i)	all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells.</div>
			<div class="indent para-style-override-12"><span>(ii)	all cells arise from pre-existing cells.</span></div>
<div class="indent para-style-override-12"><br/></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-11"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.3	An Overview of Cell</span></h3>
			<div class="text">You have earlier observed cells in an onion peel and/or human cheek cells under the microscope. Let us recollect their structure. The onion cell which is a typical plant cell, has a distinct cell wall as its outer boundary and just within it is the cell membrane. The cells of the human cheek have an outer membrane as the delimiting structure of the cell. Inside each cell is a dense membrane bound structure called nucleus. This nucleus contains the chromosomes which in turn contain the genetic material, DNA. Cells that have membrane bound nuclei are called eukaryotic whereas cells that lack a membrane bound nucleus are prokaryotic. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, a semi-fluid matrix called cytoplasm occupies the volume of the cell. The cytoplasm is the main arena of cellular activities in both the plant and animal cells. Various chemical reactions occur in it to keep the cell in the ‘living state’.</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Besides the nucleus, the eukaryotic cells have other membrane bound  distinct structures called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">organelles </span><span>like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the golgi complex, lysosomes, mitochondria, microbodies and vacuoles. The prokaryotic cells lack such membrane bound organelles.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Ribosomes are non-membrane bound organelles found in all cells – both eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic. Within the cell, ribosomes are found not only in the cytoplasm but also within the two organelles – chloroplasts (in plants) and mitochondria and on rough ER.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Animal cells contain another non-membrane bound organelle called   centrosome which helps in cell division.</div>

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Cells differ greatly in size, shape and activities (Figure 8.1). For example, Mycoplasmas, the smallest cells, are only 0.3 </span><span class="char-style-override-15">µ</span><span>m in length while bacteria could be 3 to 5 </span><span class="char-style-override-15">µ</span><span>m. The largest isolated single cell is the egg of an ostrich. Among multicellular organisms, human red blood cells are about 7.0 </span><span class="char-style-override-15">µ</span><span>m in diameter. Nerve cells are some of the longest cells. Cells also vary greatly in their shape. They may be disc-like, polygonal, columnar, cuboid, thread like, or even irregular. The shape of the cell may vary with the function they perform.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-13"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.4 	Prokaryotic Cells</span></h3>
			<div class="text">The prokaryotic cells are represented by bacteria, blue-green algae, mycoplasma and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms). They are generally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cells (Figure 8.2). They may vary greatly in shape and size. The four basic shapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (comma shaped) and spirillum (spiral).</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
<div class="text">The organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar even though prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All prokaryotes have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane except in mycoplasma. The fluid matrix filling the cell is the cytoplasm. There is no well-defined nucleus. The genetic material is basically naked, not enveloped by a nuclear membrane. In addition to the genomic DNA (the single chromosome/circular DNA), many bacteria have small circular DNA outside the genomic DNA. These smaller DNA are called plasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certain unique phenotypic characters to such bacteria. One such character is resistance to antibiotics. In higher classes you will learn that this plasmid DNA is used to monitor bacterial transformation with foreign DNA. Nuclear membrane is found in eukaryotes. No organelles, like the ones in eukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except for ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something unique in the form of inclusions. A specialised differentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic of prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane.</div>

			<div class="text"><span>Most prokaryotic cells, particularly the bacterial cells, have a chemically complex cell envelope. The cell envelope consists of a tightly bound three layered structure i.e., the outermost glycocalyx followed by the cell wall and then the plasma membrane. Although each layer of the envelope performs distinct function</span>, they act together as a single protective unit. Bacteria can be classified into two groups on the basis of the differences in the cell envelopes and the manner in which they respond to the staining procedure developed by Gram viz., those that take up the gram stain are <span class="char-style-override-14">Gram positive</span> and the others that do not are called <span class="char-style-override-14">Gram negative</span> bacteria.</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Glycocalyx differs in composition and thickness among different bacteria. It could be a loose sheath called the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">slime layer</span><span> in some, while in others it may be thick and tough, called the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">capsule</span><span>. The </span><span class="char-style-override-14">cell wall</span><span> determines the shape of the cell and provides a strong structural support to prevent the bacterium from bursting or collapsing.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">The plasma membrane is selectively permeable in nature and interacts with the outside world. This membrane is similar structurally to that of the eukaryotes.</div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>A special membranous structure is the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">mesosome</span><span> which is formed by the extensions of plasma membrane into the cell. These extensions are in the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">form of vesicles, tubules and lamellae</span><span>. They help in cell wall formation, DNA replication and distribution to daughter cells. They also help in respiration, secretion processes, to increase the surface area of the plasma membrane and enzymatic content. In some prokaryotes like cyanobacteria, there are other membranous extensions into the cytoplasm called chromatophores which contain pigments.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Bacterial cells may be motile or non-motile. If motile, they have thin filamentous extensions from their cell wall called flagella. Bacteria show a range in the number and arrangement of flagella. Bacterial flagellum is composed of three parts – </span><span class="char-style-override-14">filament, hook </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-14">basal body</span><span>. The filament is the longest portion and extends from the cell surface to the outside.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Besides flagella, Pili and Fimbriae are also surface structures of the bacteria but do not play a role in motility. The </span><span class="char-style-override-14">pili</span><span> are elongated tubular structures made of a special protein. The </span><span class="char-style-override-14">fimbriae</span><span> are small bristle like fibres sprouting out of the cell. In some bacteria, they are known to help attach the bacteria  to rocks in streams and also to the host tissues.</span></div>

			<h4 class="subheading para-style-override-16"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.4.2	Ribosomes and Inclusion Bodies</span></h4>
			<div class="text">In prokaryotes, ribosomes are associated with the plasma membrane of the cell. They are about 15 nm by 20 nm in size and are made of two subunits - 50S and 30S units which when present together form 70S prokaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may attach to a single mRNA and form a chain called <span class="char-style-override-14">polyribosomes</span> or <span class="char-style-override-14">polysome</span>. The ribosomes of a polysome translate the mRNA into proteins.</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-14">Inclusion bodies:</span><span> Reserve material in prokaryotic cells are stored in the cytoplasm in the form of inclusion bodies. These are not bound by any membrane system and lie free in the cytoplasm, e.g., phosphate granules, cyanophycean granules and glycogen granules. Gas vacuoles are found in blue green and purple and green photosynthetic bacteria.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-11"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.5	Eukaryotic Cells</span></h3>
			<div class="text">The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition, eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes.</div>

<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles which are absent in almost all plant cells (Figure 8.3).</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Let us now look at individual cell organelles to understand their structure and functions.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<h4 class="subheading para-style-override-16"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.5.1 Cell Membrane</span></h4>
			<div class="text">The detailed structure of the membrane was studied only after the advent of the electron microscope in the 1950s. Meanwhile, chemical studies on the cell membrane, especially in human red blood cells (RBCs), enabled  the scientists to deduce the possible structure of plasma membrane. </div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">These studies showed that the cell membrane is mainly composed of lipids and proteins. The major lipids are phospholipids that are arranged in a bilayer. Also, the lipids are arranged within the membrane with the polar head towards the outer sides and the hydrophobic tails towards the inner part.This ensures that the nonpolar tail of saturated hydrocarbons is protected from the aqueous environment (Figure 8.4).  In addition to phospholipids membrane also contains cholesterol.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Later, biochemical investigation clearly revealed that the cell membranes also possess protein and carbohydrate. The ratio of protein and lipid varies considerably in different cell types. In human beings, the  membrane of the erythrocyte has approximately 52 per cent protein and 40 per cent lipids.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Depending on the ease of extraction, membrane proteins can be classified as integral and peripheral. Peripheral proteins lie on the surface of membrane while the integral proteins are partially or totally buried in the membrane.</div>
<div class="text-10-5" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot from 2020-08-26 08-58-58" src="../Images/Screenshot%20from%202020-08-26%2008-58-58.png"/><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>An improved model of  the structure of cell membrane was proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) widely accepted as </span><span class="char-style-override-14">fluid mosaic model </span><span>(Figure 8.4). According to this, the quasi-fluid nature of lipid enables lateral movement of proteins within the overall bilayer. This ability to move within the membrane is measured as its fluidity.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">The fluid nature of the membrane is also important from the point of view of functions like cell growth, formation of intercellular junctions, secretion, endocytosis, cell division etc.</div>
<div class="text-10-5">One of the most important functions of the plasma membrane is the transport of the molecules across it. The membrane is selectively permeable to some molecules present on either side of it. Many molecules can move briefly across the membrane without any requirement of energy and this is called the&#160;<span class="char-style-override-14">passive transport</span>. Neutral solutes may move across the membrane by the process of simple diffusion along the concentration gradient, i.e., from higher concentration to the lower. Water may also move across this membrane from higher to lower concentration. Movement of water by diffusion is called&#160;<span class="char-style-override-14">osmosis</span>. As the polar molecules cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer, they require a carrier protein of the membrane to facilitate their transport across the membrane. A few ions or molecules are transported across the membrane against their concentration gradient, i.e., from lower to the higher concentration. Such a transport is an energy dependent process, in which ATP is utilised and is called&#160;<span class="char-style-override-14">active transport</span>, e.g., Na<span class="char-style-override-19" style="vertical-align: super;">+</span>/K<span class="char-style-override-19" style="vertical-align: super;">+</span>&#160;Pump.</div>
<h4 class="text">8.5.2	Cell Wall<br/></h4>
<div class="text">As you may recall, a non-living rigid structure called the cell wall forms an outer covering for the plasma membrane of fungi and plants. Cell wall not only gives shape to the cell and protects the cell from mechanical damage and infection, it also helps in cell-to-cell interaction and provides barrier to undesirable macromolecules. Algae have cell wall, made of cellulose, galactans, mannans and minerals like calcium carbonate, while in other plants it consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins and proteins. The cell wall of a young plant cell, the <span class="char-style-override-14">primary wall </span>is capable of growth, which gradually diminishes as the cell matures and the secondary wall is formed on the inner (towards membrane) side of the cell.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The middle lamella is a layer mainly of calcium pectate which holds or glues the different neighbouring cells together. The cell wall and middle lamellae may be traversed by plasmodesmata which connect the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<h4 class="subheading para-style-override-16"><span class="char-style-override-12">8.5.3	Endomembrane System</span></h4>
			<div class="text">While each of the membranous organelles is distinct in terms of its structure and function, many of these are considered together as an endomembrane system because their functions are coordinated. The endomembrane system include endoplasmic reticulum (ER), golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. Since the functions of the mitochondria, chloroplast and peroxisomes are not coordinated with the above components, these are not considered as part of the endomembrane system.<span></span></div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-20">8.5.3.1	The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)</span></h4>
			<div class="text">Electron microscopic studies of eukaryotic cells reveal the presence of a network or reticulum of tiny tubular structures scattered in the cytoplasm that is called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Figure 8.5).  Hence, ER divides the intracellular space into two distinct compartments, i.e., luminal (inside ER) and extra luminal (cytoplasm) compartments.</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The ER often shows ribosomes attached to their outer surface. The endoplasmic reticulun bearing ribosomes on their surface is called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). In the absence of ribosomes they appear smooth and are called smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER).</span><span class="char-style-override-13"></span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">RER is frequently observed in the cells actively involved in protein synthesis and secretion. They are extensive and continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus. </div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major site for synthesis of lipid. In animal cells lipid-like steroidal hormones are synthesised in SER.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-20">8.5.3.2	Golgi apparatus</span></h4>
			<div class="text">Camillo Golgi (1898) first observed densely stained reticular structures near the nucleus. These were later named Golgi bodies after him. They consist of many flat, disc-shaped sacs or cisternae of 0.5<span class="char-style-override-15">µ</span>m to 1.0<span class="char-style-override-15">µ</span>m diameter (Figure 8.6). These are stacked parallel to each other. Varied number of cisternae are present in a Golgi complex.

Each mitochondrion is a double membrane-bound structure with the outer membrane and the inner membrane dividing its lumen distinctly into two aqueous compartments, i.e., the outer compartment and the inner compartment. The inner compartment is filled with a dense homogeneous substance called the <span class="char-style-override-14">matrix</span>. The outer membrane forms the continuous limiting boundary of the organelle. The inner membrane forms a number of infoldings called the cristae (sing.: crista) towards the matrix (Figure 8.7). The cristae increase the surface area. The two membranes have their own specific enzymes associated with the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are the sites of aerobic respiration. They produce cellular energy in the form of ATP, hence they are called ‘power houses’ of the cell. The matrix also possesses single circular DNA molecule, a few RNA molecules, ribosomes (70S) and the components required for the synthesis of proteins. The mitochondria divide by fission.</div>

<div class="question para-style-override-29"><h3 class="question para-style-override-29">Summary</h3>
<div class="question para-style-override-29">All organisms are made of cells or aggregates of cells. Cells vary in their shape, size and activities/functions. Based on the presence or absence of a membrane bound nucleus and other organelles, cells and hence organisms can be named as eukaryotic or prokaryotic.</div>
<div class="question para-style-override-29">A typical eukaryotic cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable and facilitates transport of several molecules. The endomembrane system includes ER, golgi complex, lysosomes and vacuoles. All the cell organelles perform different but specific functions. Centrosome and centriole form the basal body of cilia and flagella that facilitate locomotion. In animal cells, centrioles also form spindle apparatus during cell division. Nucleus contains nucleoli and chromatin network. It not only controls the activities of organelles but also plays a major role in heredity.</div>
</div>
<div class="question para-style-override-29"><div class="question para-style-override-29">Endoplasmic reticulum contains tubules or cisternae. They are of two types: rough and smooth. ER helps in the transport of substances, synthesis of proteins, lipoproteins and glycogen. The golgi body is a membranous organelle composed of flattened sacs. The secretions of cells are packed in them and transported from the cell. Lysosomes are single membrane structures containing enzymes for digestion of all types of macromolecules. Ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis. These occur freely in the cytoplasm or are associated with ER. Mitochondria help in oxidative phosphorylation and generation of adenosine triphosphate. They are bound by double membrane; the outer membrane is smooth and inner one folds into several cristae. Plastids are pigment containing organelles found in plant cells only. In plant cells, chloroplasts are responsible for trapping light energy essential for photosynthesis. The grana, in the plastid, is the site of light reactions and the stroma of dark reactions. The green coloured plastids are chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll, whereas the other coloured plastids are chromoplasts, which may contain pigments like carotene and xanthophyll. The nucleus is enclosed by nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure with nuclear pores. The inner membrane encloses the nucleoplasm and the chromatin material. Thus, cell is the structural and functional unit of life.</div>
