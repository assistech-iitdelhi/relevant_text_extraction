			<div class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-3">The description of the diverse forms of life on earth was made only by observation – through naked eyes or later through magnifying lenses and microscopes. This description is mainly of gross structural features, both external and internal. In addition, observable and perceivable living phenomena were also recorded as part of this description. Before experimental biology or more specifically, physiology, was established as a part of biology, naturalists described only biology. Hence, biology remained as a natural history for a long time. The description, by itself, was amazing in terms of detail. While the initial reaction of a student could be boredom, one should keep in mind  that the detailed description, was utilised in the later day reductionist biology where living processes drew more attention from scientists than the description of life forms and their structure. Hence, this description became meaningful and helpful in framing research questions in physiology or evolutionary biology. In the following chapters of this unit, the structural organisation of plants and animals, including the structural basis of physiologial or behavioural phenomena, is described. For convenience, this description of morphological and anatomical features is presented separately for plants and animals.</div>

<div class="text"><span>The wide range in the structure of higher plants will never fail to fascinate us. Even though the angiosperms show such a large diversity in external structure or </span><span class="char-style-override-14">morphology</span><span>, they are all characterised by presence of roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>In chapter</span><span>s 2 and 3, we talked about classification of plants based on morphological and other characteristics. For any successful attempt at classification and at understanding any higher plant (or for that matter any living organism) we need to know standard technical terms and  standard definitions. We also need to know about the possible variations in different parts, found as adaptations of the plants to their environment, e.g., adaptions to various habitats, for protection, climbing, storage, etc. </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">If you pull out any weed you will see that all of them have roots, stems and leaves. They may be bearing flowers and fruits. The underground part of the flowering plant is the root system while the portion above the ground  forms the shoot system (Figure 5.1).</div>

In monocotyledonous plants, the primary root is short lived and is replaced by a large number of roots.

In some plants, like grass,&#160;<span class="char-style-override-17">Monstera</span>&#160;and the banyan tree, roots arise from parts of the plant other than the radicle and are called<span class="char-style-override-14">&#160;adventitious roots&#160;</span>(Figure 5.2c). The main functions of the root system are absorption of water and minerals from the soil, providing a proper anchorage to the plant parts, storing reserve food material and synthesis of plant growth regulators.</span></div>

A few millimetres above the root cap is the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">region of meristematic activity</span><span>.  The cells of this region are very small, thin-walled and with dense protoplasm. They divide repeatedly. The cells proximal to this region undergo rapid elongation and enlargement and are responsible for the growth of the root in length. This region is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">region of elongation</span><span>. The cells of the elongation zone gradually differentiate and mature. Hence, this zone, proximal to region of elongation, is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">region of maturation</span><span>.  From this region some of the epidermal cells form very fine and delicate, thread-like structures called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">root hairs</span><span>.

<h4 class="text"><span>5.1.2 Modifications of Root<br/></span></h4>
<div class="text"><span>Roots in some plants change their shape and structure and become modified to perform functions other than absorption and conduction of water and minerals. They are modified for support, storage of food and respiration (Figure 5.4 and 5.5). Tap roots of carrot, turnip and adventitious roots of sweet potato, get swollen and store food. Can you give some more such examples? Have you ever wondered what those hanging structures that support a banyan tree are? These are called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">prop</span><span> roots. Similarly, the stems of maize and sugarcane have supporting roots coming out of the lower nodes of the stem. These are called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">stilt </span><span>roots. In some plants such as </span><span class="char-style-override-17">Rhizophora </span><span>growing in swampy areas, many roots come out of the ground and grow vertically upwards. Such roots, called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">pneumatophores</span><span>, help to get oxygen for respiration (Figure 5.5b).</span></div>

<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-13"><span class="char-style-override-15">5.2 The Stem</span><span class="char-style-override-16"></span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>What are the features that distinguish a stem from a root? The stem is the ascending part of the axis bearing branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. It develops from the plumule of the embryo of a germinating seed. The stem bears </span><span class="char-style-override-14">nodes </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-14">internodes</span><span>. The region of the stem where leaves are born are called nodes while internodes are the portions between two nodes. The stem bears buds, which may be terminal or axillary. Stem is generally green when young and later often become woody and dark brown.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">The main function of the stem is spreading out branches bearing leaves, flowers and fruits. It conducts water, minerals and photosynthates. Some stems perform the function of storage of food, support, protection  and of vegetative propagation. </div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
<h4 class="subheading para-style-override-14"><span class="char-style-override-15">5.2.1 Modifications of Stem</span><span class="char-style-override-20"></span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>The stem may not always be typically like what they are expected to be. They are modified to perform different functions (Figure 5.6). Underground stems of potato, ginger, turmeric, </span><span class="char-style-override-17">zaminkand, Colocasia </span><span>are modified to store food in them. They also act as organs of perennation to tide over conditions unfavourable for growth. Stem </span><span class="char-style-override-14">tendrils</span><span> which develop from axillary buds, are slender and spirally coiled and help plants to climb such as in gourds (cucumber, pumpkins, watermelon) and grapevines. Axillary buds of stems may also get modified into woody, straight and pointed </span><span class="char-style-override-14">thorns</span><span>. Thorns are found in many  plants such as </span><span class="char-style-override-17">Citrus</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-17">Bougainvillea</span><span>. They protect plants from browsing animals. Some plants of arid regions modify their stems into flattened (</span><span class="char-style-override-17">Opuntia</span><span>), or fleshy cylindrical </span><span class="char-style-override-17">(Euphorbia) </span><span>structures. They contain chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis. Underground stems of some plants such as grass and strawberry, etc., spread to new niches and when older parts die new plants are formed. In plants like mint and jasmine a slender lateral branch arises from the base of the main axis and after growing aerially for some time arch downwards to touch the ground. A lateral branch with short internodes and  each node bearing a rosette of leaves and a tuft of roots is found in aquatic plants like </span><span class="char-style-override-17">Pistia</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-17">Eichhornia</span><span>.  In banana, pineapple and </span><span class="char-style-override-17">Chrysanthemum</span><span>, the lateral branches originate from the basal and underground portion of the main stem, grow horizontally beneath the soil and then come out obliquely upward giving rise to leafy shoots.</span></div>

			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-14"><span class="char-style-override-15">5.3 The Leaf</span><span class="char-style-override-16"></span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>The leaf is a lateral, generally flattened structure borne on the stem. It develops at the node and bears a bud in its axil. The </span><span class="char-style-override-14">axillary bud </span><span>later develops into a branch. Leaves originate from shoot apical meristems and are arranged in an acropetal order. They are the most important vegetative organs for photosynthesis. </span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>A typical leaf consists of three main parts:  leaf base, petiole and lamina (Figure 5.7 a). The leaf</span><span class="char-style-override-14"> </span><span>is attached to the stem by the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">leaf base</span><span> and may </span><span>bear two lateral small leaf like structures called stipules. In monocotyledons, the leaf base expands into a sheath covering the stem partially or wholly. In some leguminous plants the leafbase may become swollen, which is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">pulvinus</span><span>. The</span><span class="char-style-override-14"> petiole</span><span> help hold the blade to light. Long thin flexible petioles allow leaf blades to flutter in wind, thereby cooling the leaf and bringing fresh air to leaf surface. The</span><span class="char-style-override-14"> lamina</span><span> or the </span><span class="char-style-override-14">leaf blade</span><span> is the green expanded part of the leaf with veins and veinlets. There is, usually, a middle prominent vein, which is known as the midrib. Veins provide rigidity to the leaf blade and act as channels of transport for water, minerals and food materials. The shape, margin, apex, surface and extent of incision of lamina varies in different leaves.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>The arrangement of veins and the veinlets in the lamina of leaf is termed as </span><span class="char-style-override-14">venation</span><span>. When the veinlets form a network, the venation is termed as </span><span class="char-style-override-14">reticulate </span><span>(Figure 5.7 b). When the veins run parallel to each other within a lamina, the venation is termed as </span><span class="char-style-override-14">parallel </span><span>(Figure 5.7 c). Leaves of dicotyledonous plants generally possess reticulate venation, while parallel venation is the characteristic of most monocotyledons.</span></div>

<div class="text"><span>A leaf is said to be </span><span class="char-style-override-14">simple</span><span>, when its lamina is entire or when incised, the incisions do not touch the midrib.

A bud is present in the axil of petiole in both simple and compound leaves, but not in the axil of leaflets of the compound leaf.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The compound leaves may be of two types (Figure 5.8).

A typical flower has four different kinds of whorls arranged successively on the swollen end of the stalk or pedicel, called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">thalamus or receptacle</span><span>. These are calyx, corolla, androecium and gynoecium. Calyx and corolla are accessory organs, while androecium and gynoecium are reproductive organs. In some flowers like lily, the calyx and corolla are not distinct and are termed as perianth. When a flower has both androecium and gynoecium, it is </span><span class="char-style-override-14">bisexual</span><span>.

<h3 class="summary para-style-override-48">Summary</h3>
<div class="summary para-style-override-48">Flowering plants exhibit enormous variation in shape, size, structure, mode of nutrition, life span, habit and habitat. They have well developed root and shoot systems. Root system is either tap root or fibrous. Generally, dicotyledonous plants have tap roots while monocotyledonous plants have fibrous roots. The roots in some plants get modified for storage of food, mechanical support and respiration. The shoot system is differentiated into stem, leaves, flowers and fruits. The morphological features of stems like the presence of nodes and internodes, multicellular hair and positively phototropic nature help to differentiate the stems from roots. Stems also get modified to perform diverse functions such as storage of food, vegetative propagation and protection under different conditions. Leaf is a lateral outgrowth of stem developed exogeneously at the node. These are green in colour to perform the function of photosynthesis. Leaves exhibit marked variations in their shape, size, margin, apex and extent of incisions of leaf blade (lamina). Like other parts of plants, the leaves also get modified into other structures such as tendrils, spines for climbing and protection respectively.</div>
</div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-49">The flower is a modified shoot, meant for sexual reproduction. The flowers are arranged in different types of inflorescences. They exhibit enormous variation in structure, symmetry, position of ovary in relation to other parts, arrangement of petals, sepals, ovules etc. After fertilisation, the ovary is modified into fruits and ovules into seeds. Seeds either may be monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. They vary in shape, size and period of viability. The floral characteristics form the basis of classification and identification of flowering plants. This can be illustrated through semi-technical descriptions of families. Hence, a flowering plant is described in a definite sequence by using scientific terms. The floral features are represented in the summarised form as floral diagrams and floral formula.</div>
