			<div class="No-Paragraph-Style para-style-override-4">The description of structure and variation of living organisms over a period of time, ended up as two, apparently irreconcilable perspectives on biology. The two perspectives essentially rested on two levels of organisation of life forms and phenomena. One described at organismic and above level of organisation while the second described at cellular and molecular level of organisation. The first resulted in ecology and related disciplines. The second resulted in physiology and biochemistry. Description of physiological processes, in flowering plants as an example, is what is given in the chapters in this unit. The processes of mineral nutrition of plants, photosynthesis, transport, respiration and ultimately plant growth and development are described in molecular terms but in the context of cellular activities and even at organism level. Wherever appropriate, the relation of the physiological processes to environment is also discussed.</div>

			<div class="text"><span>Have you ever wondered how water reaches the top of tall trees, or for that matter how and why substances move from one cell to </span><span>the other, whether all substances move in a similar way, in the same direction and whether metabolic energy is required for moving substances.  Plants need to move molecules over very long distances, much more than animals do; they also do not have a circulatory system in place.  Water taken up by the roots has to reach all parts of the plant, up to the very tip of the growing stem.  The photosynthates or food synthesised by the leaves have also to be moved to all parts including the root tips embedded deep inside the soil.  Movement across short distances, say within the cell, across the membranes and from cell to cell within the tissue has also to take place. To understand some of the transport processes that take place in plants, one would have to recollect one’s basic knowledge about the structure of the cell and the anatomy of the plant body.  We also need to revisit our understanding of diffusion, besides gaining some knowledge about chemical potential and ions. </span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>When we talk of the movement of substances we need first to define what kind of movement we are talking about, and also what substances we are looking at. In a flowering plant the substances that would need to be transported are water, mineral nutrients, organic nutrients and plant growth regulators. Over small distances substances move by diffusion and by cytoplasmic streaming supplemented by active transport.  Transport over longer distances proceeds through the vascular system (the xylem and the phloem) and is called </span><span class="char-style-override-9">translocation.</span><span></span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-9"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>An important aspect that needs to be considered is the direction of transport. In rooted plants, transport in xylem (of water and minerals) is essentially unidirectional, from roots to the stems. Organic and mineral nutrients however, undergo multidirectional transport. Organic compounds synthesised in the photosynthetic leaves are exported to all other parts of the plant including storage organs.  From the storage organs they are later re-exported.  The mineral nutrients are taken up by the roots and transported upwards into the stem, leaves and the growing regions.  When any plant part undergoes senescence, nutrients may be withdrawn from such regions and moved to the growing parts.  Hormones or plant growth regulators and other chemical signals are also transported, though in very small amounts, sometimes in a strictly polarised or unidirectional manner from where they are synthesised to other parts. Hence, in a flowering plant there is a complex traffic of compounds (but probably very orderly) moving in different directions, each organ receiving some substances and giving out some others.</span><span></span></div>

<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-10">11.1.1	Diffusion</span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>Movement by </span><span class="char-style-override-9">diffusion</span><span> is passive, and may be from one part of the cell to the other, or from cell to cell, or over short distances</span><span>,</span><span> say, from the inter-cellular spaces of the leaf to the outside.  No energy expenditure takes place. In diffusion</span><span>,</span><span> molecules move in a random fashion, the net result being substances moving from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.  Diffusion is a slow process and is not dependent on a ‘living system’. Diffusion is obvious in gases and liquids, but diffusion </span><span class="char-style-override-11">in solids </span><span>is more likely rather than </span><span class="char-style-override-11">of solids</span><span>. Diffusion is very important to plants since <br/>it</span><span> is</span><span> the only means for gaseous movement within the plant body.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Diffusion rates are affected by the gradient of concentration, the permeability of the membrane separat</span><span>ing them, temperature and pressure.</span></div>
<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-10">11.1.2	Facilitated Diffusion</span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>As pointed out earlier, a gradient must already be present for diffusion to occur.  The diffusion rate depends on the size of the substances; obviously smaller substances diffuse faster.  The diffusion of any substance across a membrane also depends on its solubility in lipids, the major constituent of the membrane. Substances soluble in lipids diffuse through the membrane faster.  Substances that have a hydrophilic moiety, find it difficult to pass through the membrane; their movement has to be facilitated.  Membrane proteins provide sites at which such molecules cross the membrane.  They do not set up a concentration gradient: a concentration gradient must already be present for molecules to diffuse even if facilitated by the proteins. This process is called </span><span class="char-style-override-9">facilitated diffusion</span><span>.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>In facilitated diffusion special proteins help move substances across membranes without expenditure of ATP energy. Facilitated diffusion cannot cause net transport of molecules from a low to a high concentration – this would require input of energy.   Transport rate reaches a maximum when all of the protein transporters are being used (saturation).  Facili</span><span>tated diffusion is very specific: it allows cell to select substances for uptake.  It is sensitive to inhibitors which react with protein side chains.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The proteins form channels in the membrane for molecules to pass through. Some channels are always open; others can be controlled.  Some are large, allowing a variety of molecules to cross. The </span><span class="char-style-override-9">porins</span><span> are proteins that form large  pores in the outer membranes of the plastids, mitochondria and some bacteria allowing molecules up to the size of small proteins to pass through.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Figure 11.1 shows an extracellular molecule bound to the transport protein; the transport protein then rotates and releases the molecule inside the cell, e.g., water channels – made up of eight different types of </span><span class="char-style-override-9">aquaporins</span><span>.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>Active transport uses energy to transport and pump molecules against a concentration gradient. Active transport is carried out by specific membrane-proteins. Hence different proteins in the membrane play a major role in both active as well as passive transport. Pumps are proteins that use energy to carry substances across the cell membrane. These pumps can transport substances from a low concentration to a high concentration (‘uphill’ transport).  Transport rate reaches a maximum when all the protein transporters are being used or are saturated.  Like enzymes the carrier protein is very specific in what it carries across the membrane.  These proteins are sensitive to inhibitors that react with protein side chains.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>Table 11.1 gives a comparison of the different transport mechanisms.  Proteins in the membrane are responsible for facilitated diffusion and active transport and hence show common characterstics of being highly selective; they are liable to saturate, respond to inhibitors and are under hormonal regulation.

			<div class="text"><span>Water is essential for all physiological activities of the plant and plays a very important role in all living organisms.  It provides the medium in which most substances are dissolved. The protoplasm of the cells is nothing but water in which different molecules are dissolved and (several particles) suspended. A watermelon has over 92 per cent water; most herbaceous plants have only about 10 to 15 per cent of its fresh weight as dry matter. Of course, distribution of water within a plant varies – woody parts have relatively very little water, while soft parts mostly contain water.  A seed may appear dry but it still has water – otherwise it would not be alive and respiring!</span></div>
<div class="text"><span>Terrestrial plants take up huge amount water daily but most of it is lost to the air through evaporation from the leaves, i.e., transpiration. A mature corn plant absorbs almost three litres of water in a day, while a mustard plant absorbs water equal to its own weight in about 5 hours. Because of this high demand for water, it is not surprising that water is often the limiting factor for plant growth and productivity in both agricultural and natural environments.</span></div>

			<div class="text-10-5 para-style-override-15"><span>To comprehend plant</span><span>-water relations, an understanding of certain standard terms is necessary. </span><span class="char-style-override-9">Water potential (</span><span class="char-style-override-22">Ψ</span><span class="char-style-override-23">w</span><span class="char-style-override-9">)</span><span> is a concept fundamental to understanding water movement.  </span><span class="char-style-override-9">Solute potential (</span><span class="char-style-override-22">Ψ</span><span class="char-style-override-23">s</span><span class="char-style-override-9">)</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-9">pressure potential (</span><span class="char-style-override-22">Ψ</span><span class="char-style-override-23">p</span><span class="char-style-override-9">)</span><span> are the two main components that determine water potential.</span><span></span></div>
<div class="text-10-5 para-style-override-15"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Water molecules possess kinetic energy. In liquid and gaseous form they are in  random motion that is both rapid and constant. The greater the concentration of water in a system, the greater is its kinetic energy or ‘water potential’.  Hence, it is obvious that pure water will have the greatest water potential.  If two systems containing water are in contact, random movement of water molecules will result in net movement of water molecules from the system with higher energy to the one with lower energy. Thus water will move from the system containing water at higher water potential</span><span class="char-style-override-24"> </span><span>to the one having low water potential</span><span class="char-style-override-24">.  </span><span>This process of movement of substances down a gradient of free energy is called diffusion. Water potential is denoted by the Greek symbol Psi or </span><span class="char-style-override-22">Ψ</span><span> and is expressed in pressure units such as pascals (Pa).  By convention, the water potential of pure water at standard temperatures, which is not under any pressure, is taken to be zero.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>If some solute is dissolved in pure water, the solution has fewer free water molecules and the concentration (free energy) of water decreases, reducing its water potential. Hence, all solutions have a lower water potential than pure water; the magnitude of this lowering due to dissolution of a solute is called </span><span class="char-style-override-9">solute potential</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-22">Ψ</span><span class="char-style-override-23">s</span><span class="char-style-override-9">.</span><span class="char-style-override-23"> ­</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span><span class="char-style-override-22">Ψ</span><span class="char-style-override-23">s </span><span> is always negative.

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>If a pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure water or a solution, its water potential increases. It is equivalent to pumping water from one place to another. Can you think of any system in our body where pressure is built up? Pressure can build up in a plant system</span><span class="char-style-override-24"> </span><span>when water enters a plant cell due to diffusion causing a pressure built up against the cell wall, it makes the cell </span><span class="char-style-override-9">turgid</span><span> (see section 11.2.2); t</span>his increases the <span class="char-style-override-9">pressure potential</span>.

			<div class="text"><span>The plant cell is surrounded by a cell membrane and a cell wall.  The cell wall is freely permeable to water and substances in solution hence is not a barrier to movement. In plants the cells usually contain a large central vacuole, whose contents, the vacuolar sap, contribute to the solute potential of the cell. In plant cells, the cell membrane and the membrane of the vacuole, the tonoplast together are important determinants of movement of molecules in or out of  the cell.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span class="char-style-override-9">Imbibition </span><span>is a special type of diffusion when water is absorbed by solids – colloids – causing them to increase in volume.  The classical examples of imbibition are absorption of water by seeds and dry wood.  The pressure that is produced by the swelling of wood had been used by prehistoric man to split rocks and boulders.

			<div class="text"><span>At some earlier stage you might have carried out an experiment where you had placed a twig bearing white flowers in coloured water and had watched it turn colour. On examining the cut end of the twig after a few hours you had noted the region through which the coloured water moved. That experiment very easily demonstrates that the path of water movement is through the vascular bundles, more specifically, the xylem. Now we have to go further and try and understand the mechanism of movement of water and other substances up a plant.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Long distance transport of substances within a plant cannot be by diffusion alone.  Diffusion is a slow process. It can account for only short distance movement of molecules. For example, the movement of a molecule across a typical plant cell (about 50 µm) takes approximately 2.5 s. </span><span class="char-style-override-11">At this rate, can you calculate how many years it would take for the movement of molecules over a distance of 1 m within a plant by diffusion alone? </span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-11"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>In large and complex organisms, often substances have to be moved to long distances. Sometimes the sites of production or absorption and sites of storage are too far from each other; diffusion or active transport would not suffice. Special long distance transport systems become necessary so as to move substances across long distances and at a much faster rate. Water and minerals, and food are generally moved by a </span><span class="char-style-override-9">mass </span><span>or</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> bulk flow</span><span> system. Mass flow is the movement of substances in bulk or </span><span class="char-style-override-11">en masse</span><span> from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points. It is a characteristic of mass flow that substances, whether in solution or in suspension, are swept along at the same pace, as in a flowing river. This is unlike diffusion where different substances move independently depending on their concentration gradients. Bulk flow can be achieved either through a positive hydrostatic pressure gradient (e.g., a garden hose) or a negative hydrostatic pressure gradient (e.g., suction through a straw).</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The bulk movement of substances through the conducting or vascular tissues of plants is called </span><span class="char-style-override-9">translocation.</span><span>  </span></div>

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Do you remember studying cross sections of roots, stems and leaves of higher plants and studying the vascular system? The higher plants have highly specialised vascular tissues – xylem and phloem. Xylem is associated with translocation of mainly water, mineral salts, some organic nitrogen and hormones, from roots to the aerial parts of the plants. The phloem translocates a variety of organic and inorganic solutes, mainly from the leaves to other parts of the plants.</span></div>

			<div class="text">We know that the roots absorb most of the water that goes into plants; obviously that is why we apply water to the soil and not on the leaves. The responsibility of absorption of water and minerals is more specifically the function of the root hairs that are present in millions at the tips of the roots.  Root hairs are thin-walled slender extensions of root epidermal cells that greatly increase the surface area for absorption.  Water is absorbed along with mineral solutes, by the root hairs, purely by diffusion.  Once water is absorbed by the root hairs, it can move deeper into root layers by two distinct pathways: </div>
			<div class="indent para-style-override-24"><span class="char-style-override-26">•</span><span>	apoplast pathway</span></div>
			<div class="indent para-style-override-25"><span class="char-style-override-26">•</span><span>	symplast pathway</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span>The </span><span class="char-style-override-9">apoplast</span><span> is the system of adjacent cell walls that is continuous throughout the plant, except at the </span><span class="char-style-override-9">casparian </span><span>strips of the endodermis in the roots (Figure 11.6).  The apoplastic movement of water occurs exclusively through the intercellular spaces and the walls of the cells. Movement through the apoplast does not involve crossing the cell </span><span>membrane. This movement is dependent on the gradient. The apoplast does not provide any barrier to water movement and water movement is through mass flow.  As water evaporates into the intercellular spaces or the atmosphere, tension develop in the continuous stream of water in the apoplast, hence mass flow of water occurs due to the adhesive and cohesive properties of water.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The </span><span class="char-style-override-9">symplastic </span><span>system is the system of interconnected protoplasts.  Neighbouring cells are connected through cytoplasmic strands that extend through </span><span class="char-style-override-9">plasmodesmata.</span><span>  During symplastic movement, the water travels through the cells – their  cytoplasm; intercellular movement is through the plasmodesmata.  Water has to enter the cells through the cell membrane, hence the movement is relatively slower. Movement is again down a potential gradient.  Symplastic movement may be aided by cytoplasmic streaming. You may have observed cytoplasmic streaming in cells of the </span><span class="char-style-override-11">Hydrilla</span><span> leaf; the movement of chloroplast due to streaming is easily visible.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Most of the water flow in the roots occurs via the apoplast since the cortical cells are loosely packed, and hence offer no resistance to water movement.  However, the inner boundary of the cortex, the </span><span class="char-style-override-9">endodermis</span><span>, is impervious to water because of a band of suberised  matrix called the </span><span class="char-style-override-9">casparian strip</span><span>.  Water molecules are unable to penetrate the layer, so they are directed to wall regions that are not suberised, into the cells proper through the membranes. The water then moves through the symplast and again crosses a membrane to reach the cells of the xylem. The movement of water through the root layers is ultimately symplastic in the endodermis. This is the only way water and other solutes can enter the vascular cylinder. </span><span> </span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Once inside the xylem, water is again free to move between cells as well as through them. In young roots, water enters directly into the xylem vessels and/or tracheids. These are non-living conduits and so are parts of the apoplast. The path of water and mineral ions into the root vascular system is summarised in Figure 11.7. </div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Some plants have additional structures associated with them that help in water (and mineral) absorption. A </span><span class="char-style-override-9">mycorrhiza</span><span> is a symbiotic association of a fungus with a root system.  The fungal filaments form a network around the young root or they penetrate the root cells.  The hyphae have a very large surface area that absorb mineral ions and water from the soil from a much larger volume of soil that perhaps a root cannot do. The fungus provides minerals and water to the roots, in turn the roots provide sugars and N-containing compounds to the mycorrhizae. Some plants have an obligate association with the mycorrhizae.  For example, </span><span class="char-style-override-11">Pinus </span><span>seeds cannot germinate and establish without the presence of mycorrhizae.</span></div>

Choose a small soft-stemmed plant and on a day, when there is plenty of atmospheric moisture, cut the stem horizontally near the base with a sharp blade, early in the morning.  You will soon see drops of solution ooze out of the cut stem; this comes out due to the positive root pressure. If you fix a rubber tube to the cut stem as a sleeve you can actually collect and  measure the rate of exudation, and also determine the composition of the exudates.  Effects of root pressure is also observable at night and early morning when evaporation is low, and excess water collects in the form of droplets around special openings of veins near the tip of grass blades, and leaves of many herbaceous parts.  Such water loss in its liquid phase is known as </span><span class="char-style-override-9">guttation</span><span>.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Root pressure can, at best, only provide a modest push in the overall process of water transport. They obviously do not play a major role in water movement up tall trees.  The greatest contribution of root pressure may be to re-establish the continuous chains of water molecules in the xylem which often break under the enormous tensions created by transpiration. Root pressure does not account for the majority of water transport; most plants meet their need by transpiratory pull.</span></div>

<div class="text"><span>Despite the absence of a heart or a circulatory system in plants, the  upward flow of water through the xylem in plants can achieve fairly high rates, up to 15 metres per hour. How is this movement accomplished? A long standing question is, whether water is ‘pushed’ or ‘pulled’ through the plant. Most researchers agree that water is mainly ‘pulled’ through the plant, and that the driving force for this process is transpiration from the leaves. This is referred to as the </span><span class="char-style-override-9">cohesion-tension</span><span class="char-style-override-12">-</span><span class="char-style-override-9">transpiration </span><span class="char-style-override-9">pull model</span><span> of water transport. But, what generates this transpirational pull?</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Water is transient in plants. Less than 1 per cent of the water reaching the leaves is used in photosynthesis and plant growth. Most of it is lost through the </span><span class="char-style-override-9">stomata</span><span> in the leaves.

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>You have studied transpiration in an earlier class by enclosing a healthy plant in polythene bag and observing the droplets of water formed inside the bag.

			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-28"><span class="char-style-override-10">11.4	Transpiration</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>Transpiration is the evaporative loss of water by plants. It occurs mainly through </span><span class="char-style-override-9">stomata </span><span>(sing. : stoma). Besides  the loss of water vapour in transpiration, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the leaf also occurs through these stomata.  Normally stomata are open in the day time and close during the night. The immediate cause of the opening or closing of stomata is a change in the turgidity of the </span><span class="char-style-override-9">guard cells</span><span>. The inner wall of each guard cell, towards the pore or </span><span class="char-style-override-9">stomatal aperture,</span><span> is thick and elastic. When turgidity increases within the two guard cells flanking each stomatal aperture or pore, the thin outer walls bulge out and force the inner walls into a crescent shape. The opening of the stoma is also aided due to the orientation of the microfibrils in the cell walls of the guard cells. Cellulose microfibrils are oriented radially rather than longitudinally making it easier for the stoma to open.  When the guard cells lose turgor, due to water loss (or water stress) the elastic inner walls regain their original shape, the guard cells become flaccid and the stoma closes.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Usually the lower surface of a dorsiventral (often dicotyledonous) leaf has a greater number of stomata while in an isobilateral (often monocotyledonous) leaf they are about equal on both surfaces.  Transpiration is affected by several external factors: temperature, light, humidity, wind speed. Plant factors that affect transpiration include number and distribution of stomata, per cent of open stomata, water status of the plant, canopy structure etc.</div>

			<div class="text-10-5">The process of photosynthesis requires water. The system of xylem vessels from the root to the leaf vein can supply the needed water.  But what force does a plant use to move water molecules into the leaf parenchyma cells where they are needed? As water evaporates through the stomata, since the thin film of water over the cells is continuous, it results in pulling of  water, molecule by molecule, into the leaf from the xylem. Also, because of lower concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere as compared to the substomatal cavity and intercellular spaces, water diffuses into the surrounding air. This creates a ‘pull’ (Figure 11.9).</div>

			<div class="text"><span>Plants obtain their carbon and most of their oxygen from CO</span><span class="char-style-override-24">2</span><span> in the atmosphere. However, their remaining nutritional requirements are obtained from water and minerals in the soil.</span></div>

			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-10">11.5.1	Uptake of Mineral Ions</span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>Unlike water, all minerals cannot be passively absorbed by the roots. Two factors account for this: (i) minerals are present in the soil as charged particles (ions) which cannot move across cell membranes and (ii) the concentration of minerals in the soil is usually lower than the concentration of minerals in the root. Therefore, most minerals must enter the root by </span><span class="char-style-override-9">active absorption </span><span>into the cytoplasm of epidermal cells. This needs energy in the form of ATP. The active uptake of ions is partly responsible for the water potential gradient in roots, and therefore for the uptake of water by osmosis. Some ions also move into the epidermal cells passively.</span><span class="char-style-override-16"></span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Ions are absorbed from the soil by both passive and active transport. Specific proteins in the membranes of root hair cells actively pump ions from the soil into the cytoplasms of the epidermal cells. Like all cells, the endodermal cells have many transport proteins embedded in their plasma membrane; they let some solutes cross the membrane, but not others.</span><span class="char-style-override-11"> Transport proteins of endodermal cells are control points, where a plant adjusts the quantity and types of solutes that reach the xylem. </span><span>Note that the root endodermis because of the layer of suberin has the ability to actively transport ions in one direction only.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
<h4 class="text"><span>11.5.2&#160;Translocation of Mineral Ions<br/></span></h4>
<div class="text"><span>After the ions have reached xylem through active or passive uptake, or a combination of the two, their further transport up the stem to all parts of the plant is through the transpiration stream.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5">The chief sinks for the mineral elements are the growing regions of the plant, such as the apical and lateral meristems, young leaves, developing flowers, fruits and seeds, and the storage organs.  Unloading of mineral ions occurs at the fine vein endings through diffusion and active uptake by these cells.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Mineral ions are frequently remobilised, particularly from older, senescing parts.  Older dying leaves export much of their mineral content to younger leaves.  Similarly, before leaf fall in decidous plants, minerals are removed to other parts. Elements most readily mobilised are phosphorus, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium.  Some elements that are structural components like calcium are not remobilised.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>An analysis of the xylem exudates shows that though some of the nitrogen travels as inorganic ions, much of it is carried in the organic form as amino acids and related compounds. Similarly, small amounts of P and S are carried as organic compounds.  In addition, small amount of exchange of materials does take place between xylem and phloem.  Hence, it is not that we can clearly make a distinction and say categorically that xylem transports only inorganic nutrients while phloem transports only organic materials, as was traditionally believed.  </span><span></span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>Food, primarily sucrose, is transported by the vascular tissue phloem from a source to a sink. Usually the source is understood to be that part of the plant which synthesises the food</span><span>, i.e., the leaf, and sink, the part that needs or stores the food.  But, the source and sink may be reversed depending on the season, or the plant’s needs. Sugar stored in roots may be mobilised to become a source of food in the early spring when the buds of trees, act as sink; they need energy for growth and development of the photosynthetic apparatus. Since the source-sink relationship is variable, the direction of movement in the phloem can be upwards or downwards, i.e., </span><span class="char-style-override-9">bi-directional</span><span>. This contrasts with that of the xylem where the movement is always </span><span class="char-style-override-9">unidirectional, </span><span>i.e., upwards. Hence, unlike one-way flow of water in transpirati</span>on, food &#160;in phloem sap can be transported in any required direction so long as there is a source of sugar and a sink able to use, store or remove the sugar.</div>
<div class="text">Phloem sap is mainly water and sucrose, but other sugars, hormones and amino acids are also transported or translocated through phloem.<br/></div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<h4 class="subheading para-style-override-32"><span class="char-style-override-10">11.6.1	The Pressure Flow or Mass Flow Hypothesis</span></h4>
			<div class="text">The accepted mechanism used for the translocation of sugars from source to sink is called the pressure flow hypothesis. (see Figure 11.10). As glucose is prepared at the source (by photosynthesis) it is converted to sucrose (a dissacharide). The sugar is then moved in the form of sucrose into the companion cells and then into the living phloem sieve tube cells by active transport. This process of loading at the source produces a hypertonic condition in the phloem. Water in the adjacent xylem moves into the phloem by osmosis. As osmotic pressure builds up the phloem sap will move to areas of lower pressure.  At the sink osmotic pressure must be reduced. Again active transport is necessary to move the sucrose out of the phloem sap and into the cells which will use the sugar – converting it into energy, starch, or cellulose. As sugars are removed, the osmotic pressure decreases and water moves out of the phloem.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">To summarise, the movement of sugars in the phloem begins at the source, where sugars are loaded (actively transported) into a sieve tube. Loading of the phloem sets up a water potential gradient that facilitates the mass movement in the phloem. </div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Phloem tissue is composed of sieve tube cells, which form long columns with holes in their end walls called sieve plates. Cytoplasmic strands pass through the holes in the sieve plates, so forming continuous filaments. As hydrostatic pressure in the sieve tube </span><span>of phloem increases, pressure flow begins, and the sap moves through the phloem. Meanwhile, at the sink, incoming sugars are actively transported out of the phloem and removed as complex carbohydrates. The loss of solute produces a high water potential in the phloem, and water passes out, returning eventually to xylem.</span></div>

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>A simple experiment, called girdling, was used to identify the tissues through which food is transported. On the trunk of a tree a ring of bark up to a depth of the phloem layer, can be carefully removed.  In the absence of downward movement of food the portion of the bark  above the ring on the stem becomes swollen after a few weeks.  This simple experiment shows that phloem is the tissue responsible for translocation of food; and that transport takes place in one direction, i.e., towards the roots. This experiment can be performed by you easily.</span><span></span></div>

			<h3 class="summaryHead para-style-override-33"><span class="char-style-override-10">Summary</span></h3>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-34">Plants obtain a variety of inorganic elements (ions) and salts from their surroundings especially from water and soil. The movement of these nutrients from environment into the plant as well as from one plant cell to another plant cell essentially involves movement across a cell membrane. Transport across cell membrane can be through diffusion, facilitated transport or active transport. Water and minerals absorbed by roots are transported by xylem and the organic material synthesised in the leaves is transported to other parts of plant through phloem.</div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-35">Passive transport (diffusion, osmosis) and active transport are the two modes of nutrient transport across cell membranes in living organisms. In passive transport,  nutrients move across the membrane by diffusion, without any use of energy as it is always down the concentration gradient and hence entropy driven. This diffusion of substances depends on their size, solubility in water or organic solvents. Osmosis is the special type of diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane which depends on pressure gradient and concentration gradient. In active transport, energy in the form of ATP is utilised to pump molecules against a concentration gradient across membranes. Water potential is the potential energy of water molecules which helps in the movement of water. It is determined by solute potential and pressure potential. The osmotic behaviour of cells depends on the surrounding solution. If the surrounding solution of the cell is hypertonic, it gets plasmolysed. The absorption of water by seeds and drywood takes place by a special type of diffusion called imbibition.</div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-35">In higher plants, there is a vascular system comprising of xylem and phloem, responsible for translocation. Water minerals and food cannot be moved within the body of a plant by diffusion alone. They are therefore, transported by a mass flow system – movement of substance in bulk from one point to another as a result of pressure differences between the two points.</div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-35">Water absorbed by root hairs moves into the root tissue by two distinct pathways, i.e., apoplast and symplast. Various ions, and water from soil can be transported upto a small height in stems by root pressure. Transpiration pull model is the most acceptable to explain the transport of water. Transpiration is the loss of water in the form of vapours from the plant parts through stomata. Temperature, light, humidity, wind speed and number of stomata affect the rate of transpiration. Excess water is also removed through tips of leaves of plants by guttation.</div>
			<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-30">Phloem is responsible for transport of food (primarily) sucrose from the source to the sink. The translocation in phloem is bi-directional; the source-sink relationship is variable. The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressure-flow hypothesis.</span><span></span></div>
