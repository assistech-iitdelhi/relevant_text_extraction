<div class="text">You can very easily see the structural similarities and variations in the external morphology of the larger living organism, both plants and animals. Similarly, if we were to study the internal structure, one also finds several similarities as well as differences. This chapter introduces you to the internal structure and functional organisation of higher plants. Study of internal structure of plants is called anatomy. Plants have cells as the basic unit, cells are organised into tissues and in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. Within angiosperms, the monocots and dicots are also seen to be anatomically different. Internal structures also show adaptations to diverse environments.</div>

			<div class="text">A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues are classified into two main groups, namely, meristematic  and permanent tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing or not.</div>
<div class="text"><br/></div>
			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-5">6.1.1 Meristematic Tissues</span><span class="char-style-override-4"></span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">meristems</span><span> (</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Gk. meristos</span><span>: divided). Plants have different kinds of meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and produce primary tissues are called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">apical meristems</span><span> (Figure 6.1).</span></div>

<div class="text"><span>Roo</span><span>t apical meristem occupies the tip of a root while the sh</span><span>oot apical  meristem occupies the distant most region of the stem axis. During the formation of leaves and elongation of stem, some cells ‘left behind’ from shoot apical meristem, constitute the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">axillary bud</span><span>. Such buds are present in the axils of leaves and are capable of forming a branch or a flower. The meristem which occurs between mature tissues is known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">intercalary meristem</span><span>. They occur in grasses and regenerate parts removed by the grazing herbivores. Both apical meristems and intercalary meristems are </span><span class="char-style-override-6">primary meristems</span><span> because they appear early in life of a plant and contribute to the formation of the primary plant body.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><div class="text">The meristem that occurs in the mature regions of roots and shoots of many plants, particularly those that produce woody axis and appear later than primary meristem is called the secondary or lateral meristem. They are cylindrical meristems. Fascicular vascular cambium, interfascicular cambium and cork-cambium are examples of lateral meristems. These are responsible for producing the secondary tissues.</div><div class="text">Following divisions of cells in both primary and as well as secondary meristems, the newly formed cells become structurally and functionally specialised and lose the ability to divide. Such cells are termed permanent or mature cells and constitute the permanent tissues. During the formation of the primary plant body, specific regions of the apical meristem produce dermal tissues, ground tissues and vascular tissues.</div></span></div>

The cells of the parenchyma  are generally isodiametric. They  may be spherical, oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. Their walls are thin and made up of cellulose.

Collenchymatous cells may be oval, spherical or polygonal and often contain chloroplasts. These cells assimilate food when they contain chloroplasts. Intercellular spaces are absent. They provide mechanical support to the growing parts of the plant such as young stem and petiole of a leaf.</div>

			<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-6">Xylem</span><span> functions as a conducting tissue for water and minerals from roots to the stem and leaves. It also provides mechanical strength to the plant parts. It is composed of four different kinds of elements, namely, tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres and xylem parenchyma. Gymnosperms lack vessels in their xylem. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Tracheids </span><span>are elongated or tube like cells with thick and lignified walls and tapering ends. These are dead and are without protoplasm. The inner layers of the cell walls have thickenings which vary in form.  In flowering plants, tracheids and vessels are the main water transporting elements. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Vessel </span><span>is a long cylindrical tube-like structure made up of many cells called vessel members, each with lignified walls and a large central cavity. The vessel cells are also devoid of protoplasm. Vessel members are interconnected through perforations in their common walls. The presence of vessels is a characteristic feature  of angiosperms. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Xylem fibres</span><span> have highly thickened walls and obliterated central lumens. These may either be septate or aseptate.</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> Xylem parenchyma</span><span> cells are living and thin-walled, and their cell walls are made up of cellulose. They store food materials in the form of starch or fat, and other substances like tannins. The radial conduction of water takes place by the ray parenchymatous cells.</span></div>

The first formed primary xylem elements are called&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">protoxylem</span>&#160;and the later formed primary xylem is called<span class="char-style-override-6">metaxylem.&#160;</span>In stems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the metaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type of primary xylem is called<span class="char-style-override-6">&#160;endarch</span>. In roots, the protoxylem lies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre.

<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-6">Phloem</span>&#160;transports food materials, usually from leaves to other parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed of sieve tube elements,<span class="char-style-override-6">&#160;</span>companion cells, phloem parenchyma&#160;and phloem fibres. Gymnosperms have albuminous cells and sieve cells. They lack sieve tubes and companion cells.&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">Sieve tube elements</span>&#160;are also long, tube-like structures, arranged longitudinally and are associated with the companion cells. Their end walls are perforated in a sieve-like manner to form the sieve plates. A mature sieve element possesses a peripheral cytoplasm and a large vacuole but lacks a nucleus. The functions of sieve tubes are controlled by the nucleus of companion cells. The&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">companion cells</span>&#160;are specialised parenchymatous cells, which are closely associated with sieve tube elements. The sieve tube elements and companion cells are connected by pit fields present between their common longitudinal walls. The companion cells help in maintaining the pressure gradient in the sieve tubes.&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">Phloem parenchyma&#160;</span>is made up of elongated, tapering cylindrical cells which have dense cytoplasm and nucleus. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and has pits through which plasmodesmatal connections exist between the cells. The phloem parenchyma stores food material and other substances like resins, latex and mucilage. Phloem parenchyma is absent in most of the monocotyledons.&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">Phloem fibres</span>&#160;(bast fibres) are made up of sclerenchymatous cells. These are generally absent in the primary phloem but are found in the secondary phloem. These are much elongated, unbranched and have pointed, needle like apices. The cell wall of phloem fibres is quite thick. At maturity, these fibres lose their protoplasm and become dead. Phloem fibres of jute, flax and hemp are used commercially. The first formed primary phloem consists of narrow sieve tubes and is referred to as&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">protophloem</span>&#160;and the later formed phloem has bigger sieve tubes and is referred to as&#160;<span class="char-style-override-6">metaphloem</span>.</div>

			<div class="text"><span>We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present. Let us now consider how tissues vary depending on their location in the plant body. Their structure and function would also be dependent on location. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or fundamental tissue system and the vascular or con</span><span>ducting tissue system.</span></div>
			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-5">6.2.1 Epidermal Tissue System</span><span class="char-style-override-12"></span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>The epidermal tissue system forms the outer-most covering of the whole plant body and comprises epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages – the trichomes and hairs. The </span><span class="char-style-override-6">epidermis</span><span> is the outermost layer of the primary plant body. It is made up of elongated, compactly arranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epidermis is usually single-layered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cuticle</span><span> which prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Stomata</span><span> are structures present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-shaped cells known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">guard cells </span><span>which enclose stomatal pore</span><span class="char-style-override-6">. </span><span>In grasses, the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and size and are known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">subsidiary cells</span><span>. The stomatal aperture, guard cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">stomatal apparatus </span><span>(Figure 6.4).</span></div>

The</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> root hairs</span><span> are unicellular elongations of the epidermal cells and help absorb water and minerals from the soil. On the stem the epidermal hairs are called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">trichomes</span><span>. The trichomes in the shoot system are usually multicellular. They may be branched  or unbranched and soft or stiff. They may even be secretory. The trichomes help in preventing water loss due to transpiration. </span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>All tissues except epidermis and vascular bundles constitute the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">ground tissue</span><span>. It consists of simple tissues such as parenchyma, collenchyma and sclerenchyma. Parenchymatous cells are usually present in cortex, pericycle, pith and medullary rays, in the primary stems and roots. In leaves, the ground tissue consists of thin-walled chloroplast containing cells and is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">mesophyll</span><span>.</span></div>
<h4 class="text"><span>6.2.3 The Vascular Tissue System<br/></span></h4>
<div class="text"><span>The vascular system consists of complex tissues, the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and phloem together constitute vascular bundles (Figure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cambium </span><span>is present between phloem and xylem. Such vascular bundles because of the presence of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">open vascular</span><span> </span><span class="char-style-override-6">bundles</span><span>. In the monocotyledons, the vascular bundles have no cambium present in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary tissues they are referred to as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">closed</span><span>. When xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are arranged in an alternate manner along the  different radii, the arrangement is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">radial</span><span> such as in roots. In </span><span class="char-style-override-6">conjoint </span><span>type of vascular bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly situated  along the same radius of vascular bundles.

			<div class="text"><span>The meristematic layer that is responsible for cutting off vascular tissues – xylem and pholem – is called vascular cambium. In the young stem it is present in patches as a single layer between the xylem and phloem. Later it forms a complete ring.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>In dicot stems, the cells of cambium present between primary xylem and primary phloem is the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">intrafascicular cambium</span><span>. The cells of medullary rays, adjoining these</span><span> intrafascicular cambium become meristematic and form the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">interfascicular cambium</span><span>. Thus, a continuous ring of cambium is formed.</span></div>
			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-11">6.4.1.2 Activity of the cambial ring</span><span class="char-style-override-4"></span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span class="char-style-override-15">T</span><span>he cambial ring becomes active and begins to cut off new cells, both towards the inner and the outer sides. The cells cut off towards pith, mature into </span><span class="char-style-override-6">secondary xylem </span><span>and the cells cut off towards periphery mature into </span><span class="char-style-override-6">secondary phloem</span><span>. The cambium is generally more active on the inner side than on the outer. As a result, the amount of secondary xylem produced is more than secondary phloem and soon forms a compact mass. The primary and secondary phloems get gradually crushed due to the continued formation and accumulation of secondary xylem. The primary xylem however remains more or less intact, in or around the centre. At some places, the cambium forms a narrow band of parenchyma, which passes through the secondary xylem and the secondary phloem in the radial directions. These are the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">secondary medullary rays </span><span>(Figure 6.9).</span></div>

In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are not uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very active and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels with wider cavities.

<h4 class="text"><span>6.4.2 Cork Cambium<br/></span></h4>
<div class="text"><span>As the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular cambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to be replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later, another meristematic tissue called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cork cambium</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-6">phellogen </span><span>develops, usually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is made of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts off cells on both sides.

The cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem, and phelloderm are collectively known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">periderm</span><span>. Due to activity of the cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral to phellogen and ultimately these layers die and slough off.  </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Bark</span><span> is a <br/>non-technical term that refers to all tissues exterior to the vascular cambium, therefore including secondary phloem. Bark refers to a number of tissue types, viz., periderm and secondary phloem. Bark that is formed early in the season is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">early </span><span>or </span><span class="char-style-override-6">soft </span><span>bark.

<div class="text-10-5-indent31 para-style-override-17">Anatomically, a plant is made of different kinds of tissues. The plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic (apical, lateral and intercalary) and permanent (simple and complex). Assimilation of food and its storage, transportation of water, minerals and photosynthates, and mechanical support are the main functions of tissues. There are three types of tissue systems – epidermal, ground and vascular. The epidermal tissue systems are made of epidermal cells, stomata and the epidermal appendages. The ground tissue system forms the main bulk of the plant. It is divided into three zones – cortex, pericycle and pith. The vascular tissue system is formed by the xylem and phloem. On the basis of presence of cambium, location of xylem and phloem, the vascular bundles are of different types. The vascular bundles form the conducting tissue and translocate water, minerals and food material.</div>
<div class="text-10-5-indent31 para-style-override-17">Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles. The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and it increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different types of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.</div>
