			<div class="text">All of us breathe to live, but why is breathing so essential to life? What happens when we breathe? Also, do all living organisms, including plants and microbes, breathe? If so, how?</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">All living organisms need energy for carrying out daily life activities, be it absorption, transport, movement, reproduction or even breathing.  Where does all this energy come from? We know we eat food for energy – but how is this energy taken from food?  How is this energy utilised? Do all foods give the same amount of energy? Do plants ‘eat’? Where do plants get their energy from? And micro-organisms – for their energy requirements, do they eat ‘food’?</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">You may wonder at the several questions raised above – they may seem to be very disconnected.  But in reality, the process of breathing is very much connected to the process of release of energy from food.  Let us try and understand how this happens.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>All the energy required for ‘life’ processes is obtained by oxidation of some macromolecules that we call ‘food’. Only green plants and cyanobacteria can prepare their own food; by the process of photosynthesis they trap light energy and convert it into chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of carbohydrates like glucose, sucrose and starch.  We must remember that in green plants too, not all cells, tissues and organs photosynthesise; only cells containing chloroplasts, that are most often located in the superficial layers, carry out photosynthesis.  Hence, even in green plants all other organs, tissues and cells that are non-green, need food for oxidation. Hence, food has to be translocated to all non-green parts. Animals are heterotrophic, i.e., they obtain food from plants directly (herbivores) or indirectly (carnivores). Saprophytes like fungi are dependent on dead and decaying matter.  What is important to recognise is that ultimately all the food that is respired for life processes comes from photosynthesis. This chapter deals with </span><span class="char-style-override-7">cellular respiration</span><span> or the mechanism of breakdown of food materials within the cell to release energy, and the trapping of this energy for synthesis of ATP.  </span></div>
			<div class="text para-style-override-4"><span>Photosynthesis, of course, takes place within the chloroplasts (in the eukaryotes), whereas the breakdown of complex molecules to yield energy takes place in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondria  (also only in eukaryotes).  The breaking of the C-C bonds of complex compounds through oxidation within the cells, leading to release of considerable amount of energy is called </span><span class="char-style-override-7">respiration</span><span>.  The compounds that are oxidised during this process are known as </span><span class="char-style-override-7">respiratory substrates. </span><span>Usually carbohydrates are oxidised to release energy, but proteins, fats and even organic acids can be used as respiratory substances in some plants, under certain conditions.  During oxidation within a cell, all the energy contained in respiratory substrates is not released free into the cell, or in a single step. It is released in a series of slow step-wise reactions controlled by enzymes, and it is trapped as chemical energy in the form of ATP.  Hence, it is important to understand that the energy released by oxidation in respiration is not (or rather cannot be) used directly but is used to synthesise ATP, which is broken down whenever (and wherever) energy needs to be utilised. Hence, ATP acts as the energy currency of the cell. This energy trapped in ATP is utilised in various energy-requiring processes of the organisms, and the carbon skeleton produced during respiration is used as precursors for biosynthesis of other molecules in the cell.</span></div>
<div class="text para-style-override-4"><br/></div>
			<h4 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-8">14.1	Do Plants Breathe?  </span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>Well, the answer to this question is not quite so direct.  Yes, plants require O</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> for respiration to occur and they also give out CO</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span>.  Hence, plants have systems in place that ensure the availability of O</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span>.  Plants, unlike animals, have no specialised organs for gaseous exchange but they have stomata and lenticels for this purpose. There are several reasons why plants can get along without respiratory organs. First, each plant part takes care of its own gas-exchange needs.  There is very little transport of gases from one plant part to another.  Second, plants do not present great demands for gas exchange.  Roots, stems and leaves respire at rates far lower than  animals do. Only during photosynthesis are large volumes of gases exchanged and, each leaf is well adapted to take care of its own needs during these periods. When cells photosynthesise, availability of O</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> is not a problem in these cells since O</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> is released within the cell.  Third, the distance that gases must diffuse even in large, bulky plants is not great.  Each living cell in a plant is located quite close to the surface of the plant. ‘This is true for leaves’, you may ask, ‘but what about thick, woody stems and roots?’ In stems, the ‘living’ cells are organised in thin layers inside and beneath the bark. They also have openings called lenticels. The cells in the interior are dead and provide only mechanical support. Thus, most cells of a plant have at least a part of their surface in contact with air. This is also facilitated by the loose packing of parenchyma cells in leaves, stems and roots, which provide an interconnected network of air spaces.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The complete combustion of glucose, which produces CO</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> and H</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span>O as end products, yields energy most of which is given out as heat.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5 para-style-override-5"><img alt="Screenshot from 2020-08-25 20-00-20" src="../Images/Screenshot%20from%202020-08-25%2020-00-20.png"/><br/></div>
			<div class="text para-style-override-4">If this energy is to be useful to the cell, it should be able to utilise it to synthesise other molecules that the cell requires.  The strategy that the plant cell uses is to catabolise the glucose molecule in such a way that not all the liberated energy goes out as heat.  The key is to oxidise glucose not in one step but in several small steps enabling some steps to be just large enough such that the energy released can be coupled to ATP synthesis.  How this is done is, essentially, the story of respiration. </div>
			<div class="text para-style-override-4"><span>During the process of respiration, oxygen is utilised, and carbon dioxide, water and energy are released as products. The combustion reaction requires oxygen. But some cells live where oxygen may or may not be available. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Can you think of such situations (and organisms) where O</span><span class="char-style-override-11">2</span><span class="char-style-override-10"> is not available? </span><span>  There are sufficient reasons to believe that the first cells on this planet lived in an atmosphere that lacked oxygen.  Even among present-day living organisms, we know of several that are adapted to anaerobic conditions.  Some of these organisms are facultative anaerobes, while in others the requirement for anaerobic condition is obligate.  In any case, all living organisms retain the enzymatic machinery to partially oxidise glucose without the help of oxygen.  This breakdown of glucose to pyruvic acid is called </span><span class="char-style-override-7">glycolysis.</span></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-8">14.2	Glycolysis</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>The term glycolysis has originated from the Greek words, </span><span class="char-style-override-10">glycos</span><span> for sugar, and </span><span class="char-style-override-10">lysis</span><span> for splitting.  The scheme of glycolysis was given by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof, and J. Parnas, and is often referred to as the EMP pathway. In anaerobic organisms, it is the only process in respiration.  Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and is present in all living organisms.  In this process, glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. In plants, this glucose is derived from sucrose, which is the end product of photosynthesis, or from storage </span><span>carbohydrates. Sucrose is converted into glucose and fructose by the enzyme, invertase, and these two monosaccharides readily enter the glycolytic pathway. Glucose and fructose are phosphorylated to give rise to glucose-6-phosphate by the activity of the enzyme hexokinase. This phosphorylated form of glucose then isomerises to produce</span><span> fructose-6-phosphate. Subsequent steps of metabolism of glucose and fructose are same.  The various steps of glycolysis are depicted in Figure 14.1. In glycolysis, a chain of ten reactions, under the control of different enzymes, takes place to produce pyruvate from glucose. While studying the steps of glycolysis, please note the steps at which utilisation or synthesis of ATP or (in this case) NADH + H­­</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+ </span><span>take place.</span></div>
<div class="text" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot from 2020-08-25 19-59-14" src="../Images/Screenshot%20from%202020-08-25%2019-59-14.png"/></div>
<div class="cap  text"><span><div class="text">Figure 14.1 Steps of glycolysis</div></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">ATP is utilised at two steps: first in the conversion of glucose into glucose 6-phosphate and second in the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate is split into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL). We find that there is one step where NADH + H­­</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+ </span><span>is formed from NAD­­</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>; this is when 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) is converted to 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA).  Two redox-equivalents are removed (in the form of two hydrogen atoms) from PGAL and transferred to a molecule of NAD­­</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>. PGAL is oxidised and with inorganic phosphate to get converted into BPGA. The conversion of BPGA to 3-phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), is also an energy yielding process; this energy is trapped by the formation of ATP.  Another ATP is synthesised during the conversion of PEP to pyruvic acid.  </span><span class="char-style-override-13">Can you then calculate how many ATP molecules are directly synthesised in this pathway from one glucose molecule?</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5">Pyruvic acid is then the ke<span>y product of glycolysis. What is the metabolic fate of pyruvate?  This depends on the cellular need.  There are three major ways in which different cells handle pyruvic acid produced by glycolysis.  These are lactic acid fermentation, alcoholic fermentation and aerobic respiration. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. For the complete oxidation of glucose to CO</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> and H</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span>O, however, organisms adopt Krebs’ cycle which is also called as aerobic respiration. This requires O</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> supply.</span></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-8">14.3	Fermentation</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>In fermentation, say by yeast, the incomplete oxidation of glucose is achieved under anaerobic conditions by sets of reactions where pyruvic acid is converted to CO</span><span class="char-style-override-9">2</span><span> and ethanol. The enzymes, pyruvic acid decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase catalyse these reactions. Other organisms like some bacteria produce lactic acid from pyruvic acid.  The steps involved are shown in Figure 14.2. In animal cells also, like muscles during exercise, when oxygen is inadequate for cellular respiration pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase.  The reducing agent is NADH+H</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+ </span><span> which is reoxidised to NAD</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> in both the processes.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>In both lactic acid and alcohol fermentation not much energy is released; less than seven per cent of the energy in glucose is released and not all of it is trapped as high energy bonds of ATP.  Also, the processes are hazardous – either acid or alcohol is produced.  What is the net ATP</span><span>s that is synthesised (calculate how many ATP are synthesised and deduct the number of ATP utilised during glycolysis) when one molecule of glucose is fermented to alcohol or lactic acid?  Yeasts poison themselves to death when the concentration of alcohol reaches about 13 per cent. </span><span class="char-style-override-13">What then would be the maximum concentration of alcohol in beverages that are naturally fermented?</span><span> How do you think alcoholic beverages of alcohol content greater than this concentration are obtained?</span></div>

			<div class="text para-style-override-16"><span>The TCA cycle starts with the condensation of acetyl group with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and water to yield citric acid (Figure 14.3).

It is followed by two successive steps of decarboxylation, leading to the formation of </span><span class="char-style-override-20">α</span><span>-ketoglutaric acid and then succinyl-CoA.  In the remaining steps of citric acid cycle, succinyl-</span><span>CoA is oxidised to OAA allowing the cycle to continue.

<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-16"><span class="char-style-override-8">14.6	Amphibolic Pathway</span></h3>
<div class="text">Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. All carbohydrates are usually first converted into glucose before they are used for respiration. Other substrates can also be respired, as has been mentioned earlier, but then they do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. See Figure 14.6 to see the points of entry of different substrates in the respiratory pathway. Fats would need to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids first. If fatty acids were to be respired they would first be degraded to acetyl CoA and enter the pathway. Glycerol would enter the pathway after being converted to PGAL. The proteins would be degraded by proteases and the individual amino acids (after deamination) depending on their structure would enter the pathway at some stage within the Krebs’ cycle or even as pyruvate or acetyl CoA.</div>
<div class="text-10-5">Since respiration involves breakdown of s<span>ubstrates, the respiratory process has traditionally been considered a catabolic process and the respiratory pathway as a catabolic pathway.  But is this understanding correct?  We </span><span>have discussed above, at which points in the respiratory pathway different substrates would enter if they were to be respired and used to derive energy. What is important to recognise is that it is these very compounds that would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for the synthesis of the said substrates. Hence, fatty acids would be broken down to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as a substrate. But when the organism needs to synthesise fatty acids, acetyl CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway for it. Hence, the respiratory pathway comes into the picture both during breakdown and synthesis of fatty acids. Similarly, during breakdown and synthesis of protein too, respiratory intermediates form the link. Breaking down processes within the living organism is catabolism, and synthesis is anabolism.  Because the respiratory pathway is involved in both anabolism and catabolism, it would hence be better to consider the respiratory pathway as an </span><span class="char-style-override-7">amphibolic pathway</span><span> rather than as a catabolic one.</span></div>

			<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-23">The breaking of C-C bonds of complex organic molecules by oxidation cells leading to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Glucose is the favoured substrate for respiration. Fats and proteins can also be broken down to yield energy. The initial stage of cellular respiration takes place in the cytoplasm. Each glucose molecule is broken through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions into two molecules of pyruvic acid. This process is called glycolysis. The fate of the pyruvate depends on the availability of oxygen and the organism. Under anaerobic conditions either lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermentation occurs. Fermentation takes place under anaerobic conditions in many prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds. In eukaryotic organisms aerobic respiration occurs  in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvic acid is transported into the mitochondria where it is converted into acetyl CoA with the release of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-24">2</span><span class="char-style-override-23">. Acetyl CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid pathway or Krebs’ cycle operating in the matrix of the mitochondria.
