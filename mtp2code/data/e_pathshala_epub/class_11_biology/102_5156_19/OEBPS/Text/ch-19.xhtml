These substances have to be removed totally or partially. In this chapter, you will learn the mechanisms of elimination of these substances with special emphasis on common nitrogenous wastes. Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major forms of nitrogenous wastes excreted by the animals. Ammonia is the most toxic form and requires large amount of water for its elimination, whereas uric acid, being the least toxic, can be removed with a minimum loss of water.</span></div>
<div class="text"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The process of excreting ammonia is </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Ammonotelism</span><span>. Many bony fishes, aquatic amphibians and aquatic insects are </span><span class="char-style-override-5">ammonotelic</span><span> in nature. Ammonia, as it is readily soluble, is generally excreted by diffusion across body surfaces or through gill surfaces (in fish) as ammonium ions. Kidneys do not play any significant role in its removal. Terrestrial adaptation necessitated the production of lesser toxic nitrogenous wastes like urea and uric acid for conservation of water. Mammals, many terrestrial amphibians and marine fishes mainly excrete urea and are called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">ureotelic</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>animals. Ammonia produced by metabolism is converted into urea in the liver of these animals and released into the blood which is filtered and excreted out by the kidneys. Some amount of urea may be retained in the kidney matrix of some of these animals to maintain a desired osmolarity. Reptiles, birds, land snails and insects excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of pellet or paste with a minimum loss of water and are called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">uricotelic</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span>animals.</span><span></span></div>

In most of the invertebrates, these structures  are simple tubular forms whereas vertebrates have complex tubular organs called kidneys. Some of these structures are mentioned here. Protonephridia</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>or flame cells are the excretory structures in Platyhelminthes (Flatworms, e.g., </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Planaria</span><span>), rotifers, some annelids and the cephalochordate – </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Amphioxus</span><span>.<br/>Protonephridia are primarily concerned with ionic and fluid volume regulation, i.e., osmoregulation. Nephridia are the tubular excretory structures of earthworms and other annelids. Nephridia help to remove nitrogenous wastes and maintain a fluid and ionic balance. Malpighian tubules are the excretory structures of most of the insects including cockroaches. Malpighian tubules help in the removal of nitrogenous wastes and osmoregulation. Antennal glands or green glands perform the excretory function in crustaceans like prawns. </span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>In humans, the excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, one pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra (Figure 19.1). Kidneys are reddish brown, bean shaped structures situated between the levels of last thoracic and third lumbar vertebra close to the dorsal inner wall of the abdominal cavity. Each kidney of an adult human measures 10-12 cm in length, 5-7 cm in width, 2-3 cm in thickness with an average weight of 120-170 g. Towards the centre of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum through which ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum is a broad funnel shaped space called the renal pelvis with projections called calyces. The outer layer of kidney is a tough capsule. Inside the kidney, there are two zones, an outer </span><span class="char-style-override-4">cortex </span><span>and an inner </span><span class="char-style-override-4">medulla</span><span>. The medulla is divided into a few conical masses (medullary pyramids) projecting into the calyces (sing.: calyx). The cortex extends in between the medullary pyramids as renal columns called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Columns of Bertini </span><span>(Figure 19.2).</span></div>

				<div class="capticon para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-9">&#160;</span>Urine formation involves three main processes namely, glomerular filtration, reabsorption and secretion, that takes place in different parts of the nephron.</div>
<div class="caption para-style-override-5"><br/></div>
</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The </span><span>first step in urine formation is the filtration of blood, which is carried out by the glomerulus and is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">glomerular filtration</span><span>. On an average, 1100</span><span>-</span><span>1200 ml of blood is filtered by the kidneys per minute which constitute roughly 1/5</span><span class="char-style-override-3">th</span><span> of the blood pumped out by each ventricle of the heart in a minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood through 3 layers, i.e., the endothelium of glomerular blood vessels, the epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane between these two layers. The epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule called podocytes are arranged in an intricate manner so as to leave some minute spaces called filtration slits or slit pores. Blood is filtered so finely through these membranes, that almost all the constituents of the plasma except the proteins pass onto the lumen of the Bowman’s capsule. Therefore, it is considered as a process of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">ultra filtration.</span><span> </span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
<div class="text-10-5">The amount of the filtrate formed by the kidne<span>ys per minute is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">glomerular filtration rate</span><span> (GFR). GFR in a healthy individual is approximately 125 ml/minute, i.e., 180 litres per day !</span><span></span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">The kidneys have built-in mechanisms for the regulation of glomerular filtration rate. One such efficient mechanism is carried out by juxta glomerular apparatus (JGA). JGA is a special sensitive region formed by cellular modifications in the distal convoluted tubule and the afferent arteriole at the location of their contact. A fall in GFR can activate the JG cells to release renin which can stimulate the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR back to normal.</div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>A comparison of the volume of the filtrate formed per day (180 litres per day) with that of the urine released (1.5 litres), suggest that nearly 99 per cent of the filtrate has to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. This process is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">reabsorption</span><span>. The tubular epithelial cells in different segments of nephron perform this either by active or passive mechanisms. For example, substances like glucose, amino acids, Na</span><span class="char-style-override-3">+</span><span>, etc., in the filtrate are reabsorbed actively whereas the nitrogenous wastes are absorbed by passive transport. Reabsorption of water also occurs passively in the initial segments of the nephron (Figure 19.5).</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>During urine formation, the tubular cells secrete substances like H</span><span class="char-style-override-3">+</span><span>, K</span><span class="char-style-override-3">+</span><span> and ammonia into the filtrate.

			<div class="text"><span>Mammals have the ability to produce a concentrated urine. The Henle’s loop and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">vasa recta </span><span>play a significant role in this. The flow of filtrate in the two limbs of Henle’s loop is in opposite directions and thus forms a counter current. The flow of blood through the two limbs of </span><span class="char-style-override-4">vasa recta </span><span>is also in a counter current pattern. The proximity between the Henle’s loop and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">vasa recta</span><span>, as well as the counter current in them help in maintaining an increasing osmolarity towards the inner medullary interstitium, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL</span><span class="char-style-override-3">–1</span><span> in the cortex to about 1200 mOsmolL</span><span class="char-style-override-3">–1</span><span> in the inner medulla. This gradient is mainly caused by NaCl and urea. NaCl is transported by the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is exchanged with the descending limb of </span><span class="char-style-override-4">vasa recta</span><span>. NaCl is returned to the interstitium by the ascending portion of </span><span class="char-style-override-4">vasa recta</span><span>. Similarly, small amounts of urea enter the thin segment of the ascending limb of Henle’s loop which is transported back to the interstitium by the collecting tubule.

This mechanism helps to maintain a concentration gradient </span><span>in the medullary interstitium. Presence of such interstitial gradient helps in an easy passage of water from the collecting tubule thereby concentrating the filtrate (urine). Human kidneys can produce urine nearly four times concentrated than the initial filtrate formed.</span></div>

<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-7">19.5	Regulation of Kidney Function</span></h3>
			<div class="text">The functioning of the kidneys is efficiently monitored and regulated by hormonal feedback mechanisms involving the hypothalamus, JGA and to a certain extent, the heart.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Osmoreceptors in the body are activated by changes in blood volume, body fluid volume and ionic concentration. An excessive loss of fluid from the body can activate these receptors which stimulate the hypothalamus to release antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or vasopressin</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span>from the neurohypophysis. ADH facilitates water reabsorption from latter parts of the tubule, thereby preventing diuresis. An increase in body fluid volume can switch off the osmoreceptors and suppress the ADH release to complete the feedback. ADH can also affect the kidney function by its constrictory effects on blood vessels. This causes an increase in blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure can increase the glomerular blood flow and thereby the GFR.</span></div>
			<div>
				<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame">
					<div class="captxion para-style-override-4">The JGA plays a complex regulatory role. A fall in glomerular blood flow/glomerular blood pressure/GFR can activate the JG cells to release <span class="char-style-override-6">renin</span> which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I and further to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, being a powerful vasoconstrictor, increases the glomerular blood pressure and thereby GFR. Angiotensin II also activates the adrenal cortex to release Aldosterone. Aldosterone causes reabsorption of Na<span class="char-style-override-3">+</span> and water from the distal parts of the tubule. This also leads to an increase in blood pressure and GFR. This complex mechanism is generally known as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Renin-Angiotensin </span>mechanism.<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>An increase in blood flow to the atria of the heart can cause the release of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Atrial Natriuretic Factor</span><span> (ANF). ANF can cause vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels) and thereby decrease the blood pressure. ANF mechanism, therefore, acts as a check on the renin-angiotensin mechanism.</span></div>

<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-7">19.6	Micturition</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>Urine formed by the nephrons is ultimately carried to the urinary bladder where it is stored till a voluntary signal is given by the central nervous system (CNS). This signal is initiated by the stretching of the urinary bladder as it gets filled with urine. In response, the stretch receptors on the walls of the bladder send signals to the CNS. The CNS passes on motor messages to initiate the contraction of smooth muscles of the bladder and simultaneous relaxation of the urethral sphincter causing the release of urine. The process of release of urine is called micturit</span><span>i</span><span>on and the neural mechanisms causing it is called the micturition reflex. An adult human excretes, on an average, 1 to 1.5 litres of urine per day. The urine formed is a light yellow coloured watery fluid which is slightly acidic (pH-6.0) and has a characterestic odour. On an average, 25-30 gm of urea is excreted out per day. Various conditions can affect the characteristics of urine. Analysis of urine helps in clinical diagnosis of many metabolic discorders as well as malfunctioning of the kidney. For example, presence of glucose (Glycosuria) and ketone bodies (Ketonuria) in urine are indicative of diabetes mellitus.</span></div>

Nature of nitrogenous wastes formed and their excretion vary among animals, mainly depending on the habitat (availability of water). Ammonia, urea and uric acid are the major nitrogenous wastes excreted.</span></div>
<div class="summary para-style-override-8"><span class="char-style-override-12"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-11">Protonephridia, nephridia, malpighian tubules, green glands and the kidneys are the common excretory organs in animals. They not only eliminate nitrogenous wastes but also help in the maintenance of ionic and acid-base balance of body fluids.</div>
<div class="summary para-style-override-11"><br/></div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-11">In humans, the excretory system consists of one pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder and a urethra. Each kidney has over a million tubular structures called nephrons. Nephron is the functional unit of kidney and has two portions – glomerulus and renal tubule. Glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries formed from afferent arterioles, fine branches of renal artery. The renal tubule starts with a double walled Bowman’s capsule and is further differentiated into a proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), Henle’s loop (HL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCTs of many nephrons join to a common collecting duct many of which ultimately open into the renal pelvis through the medullary pyramids. The Bowman’s capsule encloses the glomerulus to form Malpighian or renal corpuscle.</div>
<div class="summary para-style-override-11"><br/></div>
			<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-12">Urine formation involves three main processes, i.e., filtration, reabsorption and secretion. Filtration is a non-selective process performed by the glomerulus using the glomerular capillary blood pressure. About 1200 ml of blood is filtered by the glomerulus per minute to form 125 ml of filtrate in the Bowman’s capsule per minute (GFR). JGA, a specialised portion of the nephrons, plays a significant role in the regulation of GFR. Nearly 99 per cent reabsorption of the filtrate takes place through different parts of the nephrons. PCT is the major site of reabsorption and selective secretion. HL primarily helps to maintain osmolar gradient</span></div>

DCT and collecting duct allow extensive reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes, which help in osmoregulation: H</span><span class="char-style-override-14">+</span><span class="char-style-override-12">, K</span><span class="char-style-override-14">+</span><span class="char-style-override-12"> and NH</span><span class="char-style-override-13">3</span><span class="char-style-override-12"> could be secreted into the filtrate by the tubules to maintain the ionic balance and pH of body fluids.</span></div>

The filtrate gets concentrated as it moves down the descending limb but is diluted by the ascending limb. Electrolytes and urea are retained in the interstitium by this arrangement. DCT and collecting duct concentrate the filtrate about four times, i.e., from 300 mOsmolL</span><span class="char-style-override-14">–1</span><span class="char-style-override-12"> to 1200 mOsmolL</span><span class="char-style-override-14">–1</span><span class="char-style-override-12">, an excellent mechanism of conservation of water. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder till a voluntary signal from CNS carries out its release through urethra, i.e., micturition. Skin, lungs and liver also assist in excretion.</span></div>
