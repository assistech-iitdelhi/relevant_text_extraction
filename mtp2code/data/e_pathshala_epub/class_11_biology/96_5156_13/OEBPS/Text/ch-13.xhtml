<div class="text"><span>All animals including human beings depend on plants for their food. Have you ever wondered from where plants get their food?  Green plants, in fact, have to make or rather synthesise the food they need and all other organisms depend on them for their needs. The green plants make or rather synthesise the food they need through photosynthesis and are therefore called autotrophs. You have already learnt that the autotrophic nutrition is found only in plants and all other organisms that depend on the green plants for food are heterotrophs. Green plants carry out ‘photosynthesis’, a physico-chemical process by which they use light energy to drive the synthesis of organic compounds.  Ultimately, all living forms on earth depend on sunlight for energy.  The use of energy from sunlight by plants doing photosynthesis is the basis of life on earth.  Photosynthesis is important due to two reasons: it is the primary source of all food on earth. It is also responsible for the release of oxygen into the atmosphere by green plants. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Have you ever thought what would happen if there were no oxygen to breath?</span><span> This chapter focusses on the structure of the photosynthetic machinery and the various reactions that transform light energy into chemical energy.</span></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-6"><span class="char-style-override-11">13.1	What do we Know?</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>Let us try to find out what we already know about photosynthesis.  Some simple experiments you may have done in the earlier classes have shown that chlorophyll (green pigment of the leaf), light and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> are required for photosynthesis to occur.  </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">You may have carried out the experiment to look for starch formation in two leaves – a variegated leaf or a leaf that was partially covered with black paper, and exposed to light.  On testing these leaves for the presence of starch it was clear that photosynthesis occurred only in the green parts of the leaves in the presence of light.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Another experiment you may have carried out where a part of a leaf is enclosed in a test tube containing some KOH soaked cotton (which absorbs CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>), while the other half is exposed to air.  The setup is then placed in light for some time. On testing for the presence of starch later in the two parts of the leaf, you must have found that the exposed part of the leaf tested positive for starch while the portion that was in the tube, tested negative. This showed that CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> was required for photosynthesis. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Can you explain how this conclusion could be drawn?</span></div>

			<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-11">13.2	Early Experiments</span></h3>
			<div class="text">It is interesting to learn about those simple experiments that led to a gradual development in our understanding of photosynthesis.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) in 1770 performed a series of experiments that revealed the essential role of air in the growth of green plants. Priestley, you may recall, discovered oxygen in 1774. Priestley observed that a candle burning in a closed space – a bell jar, soon gets extinguished (Figure 13.1 a, b, c, d).  Similarly, a mouse would soon suffocate in a closed space. He concluded that a burning candle or an animal that breathe the air, both somehow, damage the air.  But when he placed a mint plant in the same bell jar, he found that the mouse stayed alive and the candle continued to burn.  Priestley hypothesised as follows: Plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Can you imagine how Priestley would have conducted the experiment using a candle and a plant?  Remember, he would need to rekindle the candle to test whether it burns after a few days. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">How many different ways can you think of to light the candle without disturbing the set-up?</span><span></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Using a similar setup as the one used by Priestley, but by placing it once in the dark and once in the sunlight, Jan Ingenhousz (1730-1799) showed that sunlight is essential to the plant process that somehow purifies the air fouled by burning candles or breathing animals.  Ingenhousz in an elegant experiment with an aquatic plant showed that in bright sunlight, small bubbles were formed around the green parts while in the dark they did not.  Later he identified these bubbles to be of oxygen.  Hence he showed that it is only the green part of the plants that could release oxygen.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">It was not until about 1854 that Julius von Sachs provided evidence for production of glucose when plants grow. Glucose is usually stored as starch. His later studies showed that the green substance in plants (chlorophyll as we know it now) is located in special bodies (later called chloroplasts) within plant cells. He found that the green parts in plants is where glucose is made, and that the glucose is usually stored as starch. </div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Now consider the interesting experiments done by T.W Engelmann (1843 – 1909).  Using a prism he split light into its spectral components and then illuminated a green alga, </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Cladophora</span><span>, placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. The bacteria were used to detect the sites of O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> evolution. He observed that the bacteria accumulated mainly in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. A first action spectrum of photosynthesis was thus described. It resembles roughly the absorption spectra of chlorophyll </span><span class="char-style-override-10">a </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-10">b </span><span>(discussed  in section 13.4).</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>By the middle of the nineteenth century the key features of plant photosynthesis were known, namely, that plants could use light energy to make carbohydrates from CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> and water.  The empirical equation representing the total process of photosynthesis for oxygen evolving organisms was then understood as:</span></div>
			<div class="euqtion para-style-override-7"><span class="Basic-Graphics-Frame"><img class="frame-7" src="../Images/1560.png" alt="1560.png"/></span>&#160;</div>
			<div class="text-10-5 para-style-override-8"><span>where [CH</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>O] represented a carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, a six-carbon sugar). </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>A milestone contribution to the understanding of photosynthesis was that made by a microbiologist, Cornelius van Niel</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span><span>(1897-1985), who, based on his studies of purple and green bacteria, demonstrated that photosynthesis is essentially a light-dependent reaction in which hydrogen from a suitable oxidisable compound reduces carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. This can be expressed by:</span></div>
			<div class="euqtion para-style-override-7"><span class="Basic-Graphics-Frame"><img class="frame-8" src="../Images/1570.png" alt="1570.png"/></span>&#160;</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>In green plants H</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>O is the hydrogen donor and is oxidised to O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>. Some organisms do not release O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2 </span><span>during photosynthesis.  When H</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>S, instead is the hydrogen donor for purple and green sulphur bacteria, the ‘oxidation’ product is sulphur or sulphate depending on the organism and not O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>. Hence, he inferred that the O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2 </span><span>evolved by the green plant comes from H</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>O, not from carbon dioxide. This was later proved by using radioisotopic techniques.  The correct equation, that would represent  the overall process of photosynthesis is therefore: </span></div>

The O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> released is from water; this was proved using radio isotope techniques. Note that this is not a single reaction but description of a multistep process called photosynthesis. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Can you explain why twelve molecules of water as substrate are used in the equation given above?</span></div>
			<h3 class="headingfinal para-style-override-9"><span class="char-style-override-11">13.3	Where does Photosynthesis take Place?</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>You would of course answer: in ‘the green leaf’ or ‘in the chloroplasts’</span><span>,</span><span> based on what you earlier read in Chapter 8. You are definitely right. Photosynthesis does take place in the green leaves of plants but it does so also in other green parts of the plants. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Can you name some other parts where you think photosynthesis may occur?</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>You would recollect from previous unit that the mesophyll cells in the leaves, have a large number of chloroplasts. Usually the chloroplasts align themselves along the walls of the mesophyll cells, such that they get the optimum quantity of the incident light. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">When do you think the chloroplasts will be aligned with their flat surfaces parallel to the walls? When would they be perpendicular to the incident light? </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>You have studied the structure of chloroplast in Chapter 8. Within the chloroplast there is membranous system consisting of grana, the stroma lamellae, and the matrix stroma (Figure 13.2). There is a clear division of labour within the chloroplast. The membrane system is responsible for trapping the light energy and also for the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. In stroma, enzymatic reactions synthesise sugar, which in turn forms starch. The former set of reactions, since they are directly light driven are called </span><span class="char-style-override-15">light reactions</span><span> (photochemical reactions).</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span><span>The latter are not directly light driven but are dependent on the products of light reactions (ATP and NADPH). Hence, to distinguish the latter they are called, by convention, as </span><span class="char-style-override-15">dark reactions </span><span>(carbon reactions).</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span><span>However, this should not be construed to mean that they occur in darkness or that they are not light-dependent.</span><span></span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>Looking at plants have you ever wondered why and how there are so many shades of green in their leaves – even in the same plant? We can look for an answer to this question by trying to separate the leaf pigments of any green  plant through paper chromatography. A chromatographic separation of the leaf pigments shows that the colour that we see in leaves is not due to a single pigment but due to four pigments: </span><span class="char-style-override-15">Chlorophyll </span><span class="char-style-override-17">a</span><span class="char-style-override-10"> </span><span>(bright or blue green in the chromatogram), </span><span class="char-style-override-15">chlorophyll </span><span class="char-style-override-17">b</span><span> (yellow green), </span><span class="char-style-override-15">xanthophylls</span><span> (yellow) and </span><span class="char-style-override-15">carotenoids</span><span> (yellow to yellow-orange).  Let us now see what roles various pigments play in photosynthesis.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Pigments are substances that have an ability to absorb light, at specific wavelengths. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Can you guess which is the most abundant plant pigment in the world? </span><span>Let us study the graph showing the ability of chlorophyll </span><span class="char-style-override-10">a </span><span>pigment to absorb lights of different wavelengths (Figure 13.3 a). Of course, you are familiar with the wavelength of the visible spectrum of light as well as the VIBGYOR.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-10">From Figure 13.3a can you determine the wavelength (colour of light) at which chlorophyll a shows the maximum absorption? Does it show another absorption peak at any other wavelengths too? If yes, which one?</span><span></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Now look at Figure 13.3b showing the wavelengths at which maximum photosynthesis occurs in a plant. Can you see that the wavelengths at which there is maximum absorption by chlorophyll </span><span class="char-style-override-10">a,</span><span> i.e., in the blue and the red regions, also shows higher rate of photosynthesis. Hence, we can conclude that chlorophyll </span><span class="char-style-override-10">a</span><span> is the chief pigment associated with photosynthesis. </span><span class="char-style-override-18">But by looking at Figure 13.3c  can you say that there is a complete one-to-one overlap between the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll a and the action spectrum of photosynthesis? </span></div>

</div>
<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-2">These graphs, together, show that most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the spectrum; some photosynthesis does take place at the other wavelengths of the visible spectrum. Let us see how this happens. Though chlorophyll is the major pigment responsible for trapping light, other thylakoid pigments like chlorophyll b, xanthophylls and carotenoids, which are called accessory pigments, also absorb light and transfer the energy to chlorophyll a. Indeed, they not only enable a wider range of wavelength of incoming light to be utilised for photosyntesis but also protect chlorophyll a from photo-oxidation.<br/></div>

			<div class="text"><span>Light reactions or the ‘Photochemical’ phase include light absorption, water splitting, oxygen release, and the formation of high-energy chemical intermediates, ATP and NADPH.  Several protein complexes are involved in the process.

Special substances like ATP, carry this energy in their chemical bonds. The process through</span><span> which ATP is synthesised by cells (in mitochondria and chloroplasts) is named phosphorylation. Photo-phosphorylation is the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in the presence of light. When the two photosystems work in a series, first PS II and then the PS I, a process called non-cyclic photo-phosphorylation occurs. The two photosystems are connected through an electron transport chain, as seen earlier – in the Z scheme.

A possible location where this could be happening is in the stroma lamellae.

The excited electron does not pass on to NADP</span><span class="char-style-override-20">+ </span><span>but is cycled back to the PS I complex through the electron transport chain (Figure 13.6).  The cyclic flow hence, results only in the synthesis of ATP, but not of NADPH + H</span><span class="char-style-override-20">+</span><span>.

The chemiosmotic hypothesis has been put forward to explain the mechanism. Like in respiration, in photosynthesis too, ATP synthesis is linked to development of a proton gradient across a membrane. This time these are the membranes of thylakoid. There is one difference though, here the proton accumulation is towards the inside of the membrane, i.e., in the lumen.

			<div class="indent">(b)	As electrons move through the photosystems, protons are transported across the membrane.  This happens because the primary accepter of electron which is located towards the outer side of the membrane transfers its electron not to an electron carrier but to an H carrier.  Hence, this molecule removes a proton from the stroma while transporting an electron.  When this molecule passes on its electron to the electron carrier on the inner side of the membrane, the proton is released into the inner side or the lumen side of the membrane.</div>
			<div class="indent"><span>(c)	The NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the membrane.  Along with electrons that come from the acceptor of electrons of PS I, protons are necessary for the reduction of NADP</span><span class="char-style-override-20">+</span><span> to NADPH+ H</span><span class="char-style-override-20">+</span><span>.  These protons are also removed from the stroma.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Hence, within the chloroplast, protons in the stroma decrease in number, while in the lumen there is accumulation of protons.  This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane as well as a measurable decrease in pH in the lumen.</div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Why are we so interested in the proton gradient?  This gradient is important because it is the breakdown of this gradient that leads to the synthesis of ATP.  The gradient is broken down due to the movement of protons across the membrane to the stroma through the transmembrane channel <span>of the CF</span><span class="char-style-override-12">0</span><span> of the ATP synthase. The ATP synthase enzyme consists of two parts: one called the CF</span><span class="char-style-override-12">0</span><span> is embedded in the thylakoid membrane and forms a transmembrane channel that carries out facilitated diffusion of protons across the membrane. The other portion is called CF</span><span class="char-style-override-12">1</span><span> and protrudes on the outer surface of the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. The break down of the gradient provides enough energy to cause a conformational change in the CF</span><span class="char-style-override-12">1</span><span> particle of the ATP synthase, which makes the enzyme synthesise several molecules of energy-packed ATP. </span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><br/></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><div class="text-10-5">Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATP synthase. Energy is used to pump protons across a membrane, to create a gradient or a high concentration of protons within the thylakoid lumen. ATP synthase has a channel that allows diffusion of protons back across the membrane; this releases enough energy to activate ATP synthase enzyme that catalyses the formation of ATP.</div>
<div class="text-10-5">Along with the NADPH produced by the movement of electrons, the ATP will be used immediately in the biosynthetic reaction taking place in the stroma, responsible for fixing CO<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>, and synthesis of sugars.</div>

			<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-11">13.7	Where are the ATP and NADPH Used?</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>We learnt that the products of light reaction are ATP, NADPH and O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>. Of these O</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> diffuses out of the chloroplast while ATP and NADPH are used to drive the processes leading to the synthesis of food, more accurately, sugars. This is the </span><span class="char-style-override-15">biosynthetic phase</span><span> of photosynthesis. This process does not directly depend on the presence of light but is dependent on the products of the light reaction, i.e., ATP and NADPH, besides CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2 </span><span>and H</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>O. You may wonder how this could be verified; it is simple: immediately after light becomes unavailable, the biosynthetic process continues for some time, and then stops. If then, light is made available, the synthesis starts again.</span><span></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-10">Can we, hence, say that calling the biosynthetic phase as the </span><span class="char-style-override-17">dark reaction</span><span class="char-style-override-10"> is a misnomer? Discuss this amongst yourselves.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-10"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Let us now see how the ATP and NADPH are used in the biosynthetic phase. We saw earlier that CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> is combined with H</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>O to produce (CH</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span>O)</span><span class="char-style-override-12">n</span><span> or sugars. It was of interest to scientists to find out how this reaction proceeded, or rather what was the first product formed when CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> is taken into a reaction or fixed. Just after world war II, among the several efforts to put radioisotopes to beneficial use, the work of Melvin Calvin is exemplary. The use of radioactive </span><span class="char-style-override-20">14</span><span>C by him in algal photosynthesis studies led to the discovery that the first CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> fixation product was a&#160;3-carbon organic acid. He also contributed to working out the complete biosynthetic pathway; hence it was called </span><span class="char-style-override-15">Calvin cycle </span><span>after him. The first product identified was </span><span class="char-style-override-15">3-phosphoglyceric</span><span> acid or in short </span><span class="char-style-override-15">PGA</span><span>. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">How </span><span class="char-style-override-10">many carbon atoms does it have?</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-10"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Scientists also tried to know whether all plants have PGA as the first product of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> fixation, or whether any other product was formed in other plants. Experiments conducted over a wide range of plants led to the discovery of another group of plants, where the first stable product of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> fixation was again an organic acid, but one which had 4 carbon atoms in it. This acid was identified to be </span><span class="char-style-override-15">oxaloacetic acid</span><span> or OAA.  Since then CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> assimilation during photosynthesis  was said to be of two main types: those plants in which the first product of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> fixation is a C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> acid (PGA), i.e., the </span><span class="char-style-override-15">C</span><span class="char-style-override-22">3</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> pathway, </span><span>and those in which the first product was a C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">4</span><span> acid (OAA), i.e., the </span><span class="char-style-override-15">C</span><span class="char-style-override-22">4</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> pathway</span><span>.

They also believed that since the first product was a C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> acid, the primary acceptor would be a 2-carbon compound; they spent many years trying to identify a 2-carbon compound before they discovered the 5-carbon RuBP.</span></div>

Carboxylation</span><span> – Carboxylation is the fixation of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> into a stable organic intermediate.  Carboxylation is the most crucial step of the Calvin cycle where CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> is utilised for the carboxylation of RuBP.  This reaction is catalysed by the enzyme RuBP carboxylase which results in the formation of two molecules of 3-PGA.

<div class="text-10-5">RuBisCO that is the most abundant enzyme in the world (Do you wonder why?) is characterised by the fact that its active site can bind to both CO<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>&#160;and O<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>&#160;– hence the name.&#160;<span class="char-style-override-10">Can you think how this could be possible?</span>&#160;RuBisCO has a much greater affinity for CO<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>&#160;when the CO<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>: O<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>&#160;is nearly equal.

It is the relative concentration of O<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>&#160;and CO<span class="char-style-override-12">2</span>&#160;that determines which of the two will bind to the enzyme.</div>

In the photorespiratory pathway, there is neither synthesis of sugars, nor of ATP.

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>In C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">4</span><span> plants photorespiration does not occur.

			<div class="text"><span>An understanding of the factors that affect photosynthesis is necessary. The rate of photosynthesis is very important in determining the yield of plants including crop plants.  Photosynthesis is under the influence of several factors, both internal (plant) and external. The plant factors include the number, size, age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplasts, internal CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> concentration and the amount of chlorophyll.  The plant or internal factors are dependent on the genetic predisposition and the growth of the plant.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The external factors would include the availability of sunlight, temperature, CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> concentration and water.  As a plant photosynthesises, all these factors will simultaneously affect its rate.

Hence, at any point the rate will be determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>When several factors affect any [bio] chemical process, Blackman’s (1905) </span><span class="char-style-override-15">Law of Limiting Factors </span><span>comes into effect. This states the following:</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-10">If a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. </span><span> </span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-10"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>For example, despite the presence of a green leaf and optimal light and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> conditions, the plant may not photosynthesise if the temperature is very low. This leaf, if given the optimal temperature, will start photosynthesising.</span></div>
			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-11">13.10.1	Light</span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>We need to distinguish between light quality, light intensity and the duration of exposure to light, while discussing light as a factor that affects photosynthesis. There is a linear relationship between incident light and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> fixation rates at low light intensities. At higher light intensities, gradually the rate does not show further increase as other factors become limiting (Figure 13.10).  What is interesting to note is that light saturation occurs at 10 per cent of the full sunlight. Hence, except for plants in shade or in dense forests, light is rarely a limiting factor in nature. Increase in incident light beyond a point causes the breakdown of chlorophyll and a decrease in photosynthesis.</span></div>

<div class="text"><span>Carbon dioxide is the major limiting factor for photosynthesis.  The concentration of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> is very low in the atmosphere (between 0.03 and 0.04 per cent). Increase in concentration upto 0.05 per cent can cause an increase in CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> fixation rates; beyond this the levels can become damaging over longer periods. </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> and C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">4</span><span> plants respond differently to CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> concentrations.  At low light conditions neither group responds to high CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> conditions.  At high light intensities, both C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> and C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">4 </span><span>plants show increase in the rates of photosynthesis. What is important to note is that the C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">4</span><span> plants show saturation at about 360 </span><span class="char-style-override-28">µ</span><span>lL</span><span class="char-style-override-12">­</span><span>­­­­­</span><span class="char-style-override-20">-1</span><span> while C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> responds to increased CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> concentration and saturation is seen only beyond 450 </span><span class="char-style-override-28">µ</span><span>lL</span><span class="char-style-override-12">­</span><span>­­­­­</span><span class="char-style-override-20">-1</span><span>.  Thus, current availability of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> levels is limiting to the C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> plants.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>T</span><span>he fact that C</span><span class="char-style-override-12">3</span><span> plants respond to higher CO</span><span class="char-style-override-12">2</span><span> concentration by showing increased rates of photosynthesis leading to higher productivity has been used for some greenhouse crops such as tomatoes and bell pepper.

During this process carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is taken in by leaves through stomata and used for making carbohydrates, principally glucose and starch. Photosynthesis takes place only in the green parts of the plants, mainly the leaves. Within the leaves, the mesophyll cells have a large number of chloroplasts that are responsible for CO</span><span class="char-style-override-30">2</span><span class="char-style-override-29">&#160;fixation. Within the chloroplasts, the membranes are sites for the light reaction, while the chemosynthetic pathway occurs in the stroma. Photosynthesis has two stages: the light reaction and the carbon fixing reactions. In the light reaction the light energy is absorbed by the pigments present in the antenna, and funnelled to special chlorophyll</span><span class="char-style-override-31">a&#160;</span><span class="char-style-override-29">molecules called reaction centre chlorophylls. There are two photosystems, PS I and PS II. PS I has a 700 nm absorbing chlorophyll&#160;</span><span class="char-style-override-31">a</span><span class="char-style-override-29">&#160;P700 molecule at its reaction centre, while PS II has a P680 reaction centre that absorbs red light at 680 nm. After absorbing light, electrons are excited and transferred through PS II and PS I and finally to NAD forming NADH. During this process a proton gradient is created across the membrane of the thylakoid. The breakdown of the protons gradient due to movement through the F</span><span class="char-style-override-30">0</span><span class="char-style-override-29">&#160;part of the ATPase enzyme releases enough energy for synthesis of ATP. Splitting of water molecules is associated with PS II resulting in the release of O</span><span class="char-style-override-30">2</span><span class="char-style-override-32">, protons and transfer of electrons to PS II.</span></div></span></div>
<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-29">In the carbon fixation cycle, CO</span><span class="char-style-override-30">2</span><span class="char-style-override-29"> is added by the enzyme, </span><span>RuBisCO</span><span class="char-style-override-29">, to a 5-carbon compound RuBP that is converted to 2 molecules of 3-carbon PGA.
