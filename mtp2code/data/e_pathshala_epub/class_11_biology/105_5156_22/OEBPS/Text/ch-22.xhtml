<div class="text"><span>You have already learnt that the neural system provides a&#160;</span><span>point-to-point rapid coordination among organs. The neural coordination is fast but short-lived. As the nerve fibres do not innervate all cells of the body and the cellular functions need to be continuously regulated; a special kind of coordination and integration has to be provided. This function is carried out by hormones. The neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and regulate the physiological functions in the body.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>Endocrine glands lack ducts and are hence, called ductless glands. Their secretions are called hormones. The classical definition of hormone as a chemical produced by endocrine glands and released into the blood and transported to a distantly located target organ has current scientific definition as follows: </span><span class="char-style-override-8">Hormones are non-nutrient chemicals which act as intercellular messengers and are produced in trace amounts</span><span>. The new definition covers a number of new molecules in addition to the hormones secreted by the organised endocrine glands. Invertebrates possess very simple endocrine systems with few hormones whereas a large number of chemicals act as hormones and provide coordination in the vertebrates. The human endocrine system is described here.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>The endocrine glands and hormone producing diffused tissues/cells located in different parts of our body constitute the endocrine system. Pituitary, pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis in males and ovary in females) are the organised endocrine bodies in our body&#160;(Figure 22.1). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, heart also produce hormones. A brief account of the structure and functions of all major endocrine glands  and hypothalamus of the human body is given in the following sections.</span></div>

			<h4 class="heading"><span class="char-style-override-11">22.2.1  The Hypothalamus</span></h4>
			<div class="text">As you know, the hypothalamus is the basal part of diencephalon, forebrain (Figure 22.1) and it regulates a wide spectrum of body functions. It contains several groups of neurosecretory cells called nuclei which produce hormones. These hormones regulate the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. However, the hormones produced by hypothalamus are of two types, the releasing hormones (which stimulate secretion of pituitary hormones) and the inhibiting hormones (which inhibit secretions of pituitary hormones). For example a hypothalamic hormone called Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates the pituitary synthesis and release of gonadotrophins. On the other hand, somatostatin from the hypothalamus inhibits the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. These hormones originating in the hypothalamic neurons, pass through axons and are released from their nerve endings. These hormones reach the pituitary gland through a portal circulatory system and regulate the functions of the anterior pituitary. The posterior pituitary is under the direct neural regulation of the hypothalamus (Figure 22.2).</div>
			<h4 class="heading para-style-override-7">22.2.2  The Pituitary Gland</h4>
			<div class="text"><span>The pituitary gland is located in a bony cavity called sella tursica and is attached to hypothalamus by a stalk (Figure 22.2). It is divided anatomically into an </span><span class="char-style-override-8">adenohypophysis</span><span> and a </span><span class="char-style-override-8">neurohypophysis</span><span>. Adenohypophysis consists of two portions, pars distalis and pars intermedia. The pars distalis region of pituitary, commonly called anterior pituitary, produces </span><span class="char-style-override-8">growth hormone</span><span> (GH), </span><span class="char-style-override-8">prolactin</span><span> (PRL), </span><span class="char-style-override-8">thyroid stimulating hormone</span><span> (TSH), </span><span class="char-style-override-8">adrenocorticotrophic hormone</span><span> (ACTH), </span><span class="char-style-override-8">luteinizing hormone</span><span> (LH) and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">follicle stimulating hormone</span><span> (FSH). Pars intermedia secretes only one hormone called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">melanocyte stimulating hormone</span><span> (MSH). However, in humans, the pars intermedia is almost merged with pars distalis. Neurohypophysis (pars nervosa) also known as posterior pituitary, stores and releases two hormones called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">oxytocin </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">vasopressin, </span><span>which are actually synthesised by the hypothalamus and are transported axonally to neurohypophysis.</span></div>

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Over-secretion of GH stimulates abnormal growth of the body leading to gigantism and low secretion of GH results in stunted growth resulting in pituitary dwarfism. Excess secretion of growth hormone in adults especially in middle age can result in severe disfigurement (especially of the face) called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">Acromegaly</span><span>, which may lead to serious complications, and premature death if unchecked. The disease is hard to diagnose in the early stages and often goes undetected for many years, until changes in external features become noticeable. Prolactin regulates the growth of the mammary glands and formation of milk in them. TSH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">glucocorticoids </span><span>from the adrenal cortex. LH and FSH stimulate gonadal activity and hence are called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">gonadotrophins</span><span>. In males, LH stimulates the synthesis and secretion of hormones called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">androgens </span><span>from testis. In males, FSH and androgens regulate spermatogenesis. In females, LH induces ovulation of fully mature follicles (graafian follicles) and maintains the corpus luteum, formed from the remnants of the graafian follicles after ovulation. FSH stimulates growth and development of the ovarian follicles in females. MSH acts on the melanocytes (melanin containing cells) and regulates pigmentation of the skin. Oxytocin acts on the smooth </span>muscles of our body and stimulates their contraction. In females, it stimulates a vigorous contraction of uterus at the time of child birth, and milk ejection from the mammary gland. Vasopressin acts mainly at the kidney and stimulates resorption of water and electrolytes by the distal tubules and thereby reduces loss of water through urine (diuresis). Hence, it is also called as <span class="char-style-override-8">anti-diuretic hormone</span> (ADH).</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>An impairment affecting synthesis or release of ADH results in a dim</span>inished ability of the kidney to conserve water leading to water loss and dehydration. This condition is known as <span class="char-style-override-8">Diabetes Insipidus</span>.</div>

			<div class="text"><span>The pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of forebrain. Pineal secretes a hormone called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">melatonin</span><span>. Melatonin plays a very important role in the regulation of a 24-hour (diurnal) rhythm of our body. For example, it helps in maintaining the normal rhythms of sleep-wake cycle, body temperature. In addition, melatonin also influences metabolism, pigmentation, the menstrual cycle as well as our defense capability.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>The thyroid gland is composed of two lobes which are located on either side of the trachea (Figure 22.3). Both the lobes are interconnected with a thin flap of connective tissue called isthmus. The thyroid gland is composed of </span><span class="char-style-override-8">follicles</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">stromal tissues</span><span>. Each thyroid follicle is composed of follicular cells, enclosing a cavity. These follicular cells synthesise two hormones, </span><span class="char-style-override-8">tetraiodothyronine</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-8">thyroxine</span><span> (T</span><span class="char-style-override-13">4</span><span>) and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">triiodothyronine </span><span>(T</span><span class="char-style-override-13">3</span><span>). Iodine is essential for the normal rate of hormone synthesis in the thyroid. Deficiency of iodine in our diet results in </span><span class="char-style-override-8">hypothyroidism</span><span> and enlargement of the thyroid gland, commonly called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">goitre</span><span>. Hypothyroidism during pregnancy causes defective development and maturation of the growing baby leading to stunted growth (cretinism), mental retardation, low intelligence quotient, abnormal skin, deaf-mutism, etc. In adult women, hypothyroidism may cause menstrual cycle to become irregular. Due to cancer of the thyroid gland or due to development of nodules of the thyroid glands, the rate of synthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones is increased to abnormal high levels leading to a condition called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">hyperthyroidism </span><span>which adversely affects the body physiology.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span class="char-style-override-8">Exopthalmic goitre </span><span>is a form of hyperthyroidism, characterised by enlargement of the thyroid gland, protrusion of the eyeballs, increased basal metabolic rate, and weight loss, also called </span><span class="char-style-override-14">Graves’ disease.</span></div>
<div class="text-10-5"><span>Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate. These hormones also support the process of red blood cell formation. Thyroid hormones control the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Maintenance of water and electrolyte balance is also influenced by thyroid hormones. Thyroid gland also secretes a protein hormone called thyrocalcitonin (TCT) which regulates the blood calcium levels.</span></div>

			<h4 class="head-indent"><span class="char-style-override-11">22.2.5  Parathyroid Gland</span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>I</span><span>n humans, four parathyroid glands are present on the back side of the thyroid gland, one pair each in the two lobes of the thyroid gland (Figure 22.3b). The parathyroid glands secrete a peptide hormone called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">parathyroid hormone</span><span> (PTH). The secretion of PTH is regulated by the circulating levels of calcium ions. </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases the Ca</span><span class="char-style-override-15">2+</span><span> levels in the blood. PTH acts on bones and stimulates the process of bone resorption (dissolution/demineralisation). PTH also stimulates reabsorption of Ca</span><span class="char-style-override-15">2+</span><span> by the renal tubules and increases Ca</span><span class="char-style-override-15">2+</span><span> absorption from the digested food. It is, thus, clear that PTH is a hypercalcemic hormone, i.e., it increases the blood Ca</span><span class="char-style-override-15">2+</span><span> levels. Along with TCT, it plays a significant role in calcium balance in the body</span><span>.</span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>The thymus gland is a lobular structure located between lungs behind sternum on the ventral side of aorta. The thymus plays a major role in the development of the immune system. This gland secretes the peptide hormones called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">thymosins</span><span>. Thymosins play a major role in the differentiation of </span><span class="char-style-override-8">T-lymphocytes</span><span>, which provide </span><span class="char-style-override-8">cell-mediated immunity</span><span>.</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span><span>In addition, thymosins also promote production of antibodies to provide </span><span class="char-style-override-8">humoral immunity</span><span>.

<div class="cap text-10-5"><span><div class="text-10-5">Figure 22.4 Diagrammatic representation of : (a) Adrenal gland above kidney (b) Section showing two parts of adrenal gland</div></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The adrenal medulla secretes two hormones called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">adrenaline</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-8">epinephrine</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">noradrenaline</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-8">norepinephrine</span><span>. These are commonly called as </span><span class="char-style-override-8">catecholamines</span><span>. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are rapidly secreted in response to stress of any kind and during emergency situations and are called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">emergency hormones</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-8">hormones of Fight or Flight</span><span>. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection (raising of hairs), sweating etc. Both the hormones increase the heart beat, the strength of heart contraction and the rate of respiration. Catecholamines also stimulate the breakdown of glycogen resulting in an increased concentration of glucose in blood. In addition, they also stimulate the breakdown of lipids and proteins.</span><span></span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The adrenal cortex can be divided into three layers, called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">zona reticularis</span><span> (inner layer), </span><span class="char-style-override-8">zona fasciculata</span><span> (middle layer) and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">zona glomerulosa</span><span> (outer layer). The adrenal cortex secretes many hormones, commonly called as </span><span class="char-style-override-8">corticoids</span><span>. The corticoids, which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism are called glucocorticoids. In our body, cortisol is the main glucocorticoid. Corticoids, which regulate the balance of water and electrolytes in our body are called mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid in our body.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and proteolysis; and inhibit cellular uptake and utilisation of amino acids. Cortisol is also involved in maintaining the cardio-vascular system as well as the kidney functions. Glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol, produces anti-inflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune response. Cortisol stimulates the RBC production. Aldosterone acts mainly at the renal tubules and stimulates the reabsorption of Na</span><span class="char-style-override-15">+</span><span> and water and excretion of K</span><span class="char-style-override-15">+</span><span> and phosphate ions. Thus, aldosterone helps in the maintenance of electrolytes, body fluid volume, osmotic pressure and blood pressure. Small amounts of androgenic steroids are also secreted by the adrenal cortex which play a role in the growth of axial hair, pubic hair and facial hair during puberty.</span></div>

<h4 class="text"><span>22.2.8 Pancreas<br/></span></h4>
<div class="text"><span>Pancreas is a composite gland (Figure 22.1) which acts as both exocrine and endocrine gland. The endocrine pancreas consists of ‘Islets of Langerhans’. There are about 1 to 2 million Islets of Langerhans in a normal human pancreas representing only 1 to 2 per cent of the pancreatic tissue. The two main types of cells in the Islet of Langerhans are called </span><span class="char-style-override-16"><br/>α</span><span class="char-style-override-8">-cells</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-16">β</span><span class="char-style-override-8">-cells</span><span>. The </span><span class="char-style-override-16">α</span><span>-cells secrete a hormone called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">glucagon</span><span>, while the </span><span class="char-style-override-16">β</span><span>-cells secrete </span><span class="char-style-override-8">insulin</span><span>. </span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Glucagon is a peptide hormone, and plays an important role in maintaining the normal blood glucose levels. Glucagon acts mainly on the liver cells (hepatocytes) and stimulates glycogenolysis resulting in an increased blood sugar (</span><span class="char-style-override-8">hyperglycemia</span><span>). In addition, this hormone stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia. Glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilisation. Thus, glucagon is a </span><span class="char-style-override-8">hyperglycemic hormone</span><span>.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Insulin is a peptide hormone, which plays a major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. Insulin acts mainly on hepatocytes and adipocytes (cells of adipose tissue), and enhances cellular glucose uptake and utilisation. As a result, there is a rapid movement of glucose from blood to hepatocytes and adipocytes resulting in decreased blood glucose levels (</span><span class="char-style-override-8">hypoglycemia</span><span>). Insulin also stimulates conversion of glucose to glycogen (</span><span class="char-style-override-8">glycogenesis</span><span>) in the target cells. The glucose homeostasis in blood is thus maintained jointly by the two – insulin and glucagons.</span></div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>Prolonged hyperglycemia leads to a complex disorder called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">diabetes mellitus</span><span> which is associated with loss of glucose through urine and formation of harmful compounds known as ketone bodies. Diabetic patients are successfully treated with insulin therapy.</span></div>

			<div class="text-10-5">Androgens regulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs like epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra etc. These hormones stimulate muscular growth, growth of facial and axillary hair, aggressiveness, low pitch of voice etc. Androgens play a major stimulatory role in the process of spermatogenesis (formation of spermatozoa). Androgens act on the central neural system and influence the male sexual behaviour (libido). These hormones produce anabolic (synthetic) effects on protein and carbohydrate metabolism.<span></span></div>

			<h4 class="head-indent"><span class="char-style-override-11">22.2.10  Ovary</span></h4>
			<div class="text">Females have a pair of ovaries located in the abdomen (Figure 22.1). Ovary is the primary female sex organ which produces one ovum during each menstrual cycle. In addition, ovary also produces two groups of steroid hormones called <span class="char-style-override-8">estrogen</span> and <span class="char-style-override-8">progesterone</span>. Ovary is composed of ovarian follicles and stromal tissues. The estrogen is synthesised and secreted mainly by the growing ovarian follicles. After ovulation, the ruptured follicle is converted to a structure called <span class="char-style-override-8">corpus luteum</span>, which secretes mainly <span class="char-style-override-8">progesterone</span>. </div>
			<div class="text-10-5">Estrogens produce wide ranging actions such as stimulation of growth and activities of female secondary sex organs, development of growing ovarian follicles, appearance of female secondary sex characters (e.g., high pitch of voice, etc.), mammary gland development.

Gastrin acts on the gastric glands and stimulates the secretion of hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. Secretin acts on the exocrine pancreas and stimulates secretion of water and bicarbonate ions. CCK acts on both pancreas and gall bladder and stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile juice, respectively. GIP inhibits gastric secretion and motility. Several other non-endocrine tissues secrete hormones called </span><span class="char-style-override-8">growth factors.</span><span> These factors are essential for the normal growth of tissues and their repairing/regeneration.</span></div>

<div class="question para-style-override-21"><h3 class="question para-style-override-21">Summary</h3>
<div class="question para-style-override-21">There are special chemicals which act as hormones and provide chemical coordination, integration and regulation in the human body. These hormones regulate metabolism, growth and development of our organs, the endocrine glands or certain cells. The endocrine system is composed of hypothalamus, pituitary and pineal, thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, parathyroid, thymus and gonads (testis and ovary). In addition to these, some other organs, e.g., gastrointestinal tract, kidney, heart etc., also produce hormones. The pituitary gland is divided into three major parts, which are called as pars distalis, pars intermedia and pars nervosa. Pars distalis produces six trophic hormones. Pars intermedia secretes only one hormone, while pars nervosa (neurohypophysis) secretes two hormones. The pituitary hormones regulate the growth and development of somatic tissues and activities of peripheral endocrine glands. Pineal gland secretes melatonin, which plays a very important role in the regulation of 24-hour (diurnal) rhythms of our body (e.g., rhythms of sleep and state of being awake, body temperature, etc.). The thyroid gland hormones play an important role in the regulation of the basal metabolic rate, development and maturation of the central neural system, erythropoiesis, metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and fats, menstrual cycle. Another thyroid hormone, i.e., thyrocalcitonin regulates calcium levels in our blood by decreasing it. The parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases the blood Ca2+ levels and plays a major role in calcium homeostasis. The thymus gland secretes thymosins which play a major role in the differentiation of T-lymphocytes, which provide cell-mediated immunity. In addition, thymosins also increase the production of antibodies to provide humoral immunity. The adrenal gland is composed of the centrally located adrenal medulla and the outer adrenal cortex. The adrenal medulla secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones increase alertness, pupilary dilation, piloerection, sweating, heart beat, strength of heart contraction, rate of respiration, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, proteolysis. The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, proteolysis, erythropoiesis, cardio-vascular system, blood pressure, and glomerular filtration rate and inhibit inflammatory reactions by suppressing the immune response. Mineralocorticoids regulate water and electrolyte contents of the body. The endocrine pancreas secretes glucagon and insulin. Glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis resulting in hyperglycemia. Insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake and utilisation, and glycogenesis resulting in hypoglycemia. Insulin deficiency</div>
<div class="question para-style-override-21">and/or insulin resistance result in a disease called diabetes mellitus.</div>
<div class="question para-style-override-21">The testis secretes androgens, which stimulate the development, maturation and functions of the male accessory sex organs, appearance of the male secondary sex characters, spermatogenesis, male sexual behaviour, anabolic pathways and erythropoiesis. The ovary secretes estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen stimulates growth and development of female accessory sex organs and secondary sex characters. Progesterone plays a major role in the maintenance of pregnancy as well as in mammary gland development and lactation. The atrial wall of the heart produces atrial natriuretic factor which decreases the blood pressure. Kidney produces erythropoietin which stimulates erythropoiesis. The gastrointestinal tract secretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin and gastric inhibitory peptide. These hormones regulate the secretion of digestive juices and help in digestion.</div>
