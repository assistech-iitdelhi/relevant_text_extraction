			<div class="text"><span>As you know, the functions of the organs/organ systems in our body must be coordinated to maintain homeostasis. </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Coordination</span><span> is the process through which two or more organs interact and complement the functions of one another. For example, when we do physical exercises, the energy demand is increased for maintaining an increased muscular activity. The supply of oxygen is also increased. The increased supply of oxygen necessitates an increase in the rate of respiration, heart beat and increased blood flow via blood vessels. When physical exercise is stopped, the activities of nerves, lungs, heart and kidney gradually return to their normal conditions. Thus, the functions of muscles, lungs, heart, blood vessels, kidney and other organs are coordinated while performing physical exercises. In our body the neural system and the endocrine system jointly coordinate and integrate all the activities of the organs so that they function in a synchronised fashion.  </span></div>

			<div class="text-10-5"><span>The neural system provides an organised network of point-to-point connections for a quick coordination.

			<br/>
			<div class="text"><span>A neuron is a microscopic structure composed of three major parts, namely, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">cell body</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">dendrites</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">axon</span><span> (Figure 21.1). The cell body contains cytoplasm with typical cell organelles and certain granular bodies called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Nissl’s granules</span><span>. Short fibres which branch repeatedly and project</span><span> out of the cell body also contain Nissl’s granules and are called dendrites. These fibres transmit impulses towards the cell body.   The axon is a long fibre, the distal end of which is branched. Each branch terminates as a bulb-like structure called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">synaptic knob </span><span>which possess synaptic vesicles containing chemicals called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">neurotransmitters</span><span>. The axons transmit nerve impulses away from the cell body to a synapse or to a neuro-muscular junction. Based on the number of axon and dendrites, the neurons are divided into three types, i.e., </span><span class="char-style-override-5">multipolar</span><span> (with one axon and two or more dendrites; found in the cerebral cortex), </span><span class="char-style-override-5">bipolar</span><span> (with one axon and one dendrite, found in the retina of eye) and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">unipolar</span><span> (cell body with one axon only; found usually in the embryonic stage). There are two types of axons, namely, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">myelinated</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">non-myelinated</span><span>. The myelinated nerve fibres are enveloped with </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Schwann cells,</span><span> which form a myelin sheath around the axon. The gaps between two adjacent myelin sheaths are called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">nodes of Ranvier</span><span>. Myelinated nerve fibres are found in spinal and cranial nerves. Unmyelinated nerve fibre is enclosed by a Schwann cell that does not form a myelin sheath around the axon, and is commonly found in autonomous and the somatic neural systems.   </span></div>

<h3 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-6">21.3.1	Generation and Conduction of Nerve Impulse</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>Neurons are excitable cells because their membranes are in a polarised state. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Do you know why the membrane of a neuron is polarised?</span><span> Different types of ion channels are present on the neural membrane. These ion channels are selectively permeable to different ions. When a neuron is not conducting any impulse, i.e., resting, the axonal membrane is comparatively more permeable to potassium ions (K</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>) and nearly impermeable to sodium ions (Na</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>). Similarly, the membrane is impermeable to negatively charged proteins present in the axoplasm. Consequently, the axoplasm inside the axon contains high concentration of </span><span>K</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> and negatively charged proteins and low concentration of Na</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>. In contrast, the fluid outside the axon contains a low concentration of </span><span>K</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>, a high concentration of Na</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> and thus form a concentration gradient. These ionic gradients across the resting membrane are maintained by the active transport of ions by the sodium-potassium pump which transports 3 N</span><span>a</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> outwards for 2 </span><span>K</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> into the cell. As a result, the outer surface of the axonal membrane possesses a positive charge while its inner surface becomes negatively charged and therefore is polarised. The electrical potential difference across the resting plasma membrane is called as the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">resting potential</span><span>.</span></div>

<div class="text para-style-override-19"><br/></div>
</div>
			<div class="text-10-5"><span>You might be curious to know about the mechanisms of generation of nerve impulse and its conduction along an axon. When a stimulus is applied at a site (Figure 21.2 e.g., point A) on the polarised membrane, the membrane at the site A becomes freely permeable to Na</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>. This leads to a rapid influx of Na</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> followed by the reversal of the polarity at that site, i.e., the outer surface of the membrane becomes negatively charged and the inner side becomes positively charged. The polarity of the membrane at the site A is thus reversed and hence depolarised. The electrical potential difference across the plasma membrane at the site A is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">action potential</span><span>, which is in fact termed as a </span><span class="char-style-override-5">nerve impulse</span><span>. At sites immediately ahead, the axon (e.g., site B) membrane has a positive charge on the outer surface and a negative charge on its inner surface. As a result, a current flows on the inner surface from site A to site B. On the outer surface current flows from site B to site A (Figure 21.2) to complete the circuit of current flow. Hence, the polarity at the site is reversed, and an action potential is generated at site B.  Thus, the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">impulse </span><span>(action potential) generated at site A arrives at site B. The sequence is repeated along the length of the axon and consequently the impulse is conducted. The rise in the stimulus-induced permeability to Na</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> is extremely short-lived. It is quickly followed by a rise in permeability to K</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span>. Within a fraction of a second, K</span><span class="char-style-override-12">+</span><span> diffuses outside the membrane and restores the resting potential of the membrane at the site of excitation and the fibre becomes once more responsive to further stimulation. </span></div>

			<h4 class="subheading"><span class="char-style-override-6">21.3.2	Transmission of Impulses</span></h4>
			<div class="text"><span>A nerve impulse is transmitted from one neuron to another through junctions called synapses. A </span><span class="char-style-override-5">synapse</span><span> is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, which may or may not be separated by a gap called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">synaptic cleft</span><span>. There are two types of synapses, namely, electrical synapses and chemical synapses. At electrical synapses, the membranes of pre- and post-synaptic neurons are in very close proximity. Electrical current can flow directly from one neuron into the other across these synapses. Transmission of an impulse across electrical synapses is very similar to impulse conduction along a single axon. Impulse transmission across an electrical synapse is always faster than that across a chemical synapse. Electrical synapses are rare in our system.</span></div>

<div class="text para-style-override-2"><span>At a chemical synapse, the membranes of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons are separated by a fluid-filled space called synaptic cleft&#160;(Figure 21.3). </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Do you know how the pre-synaptic neuron transmits an impulse (action potential) across the synaptic cleft to the post-synaptic neuron</span><span>? Chemicals called neurotransmitters are involved in the transmission of impulses at these synapses. The axon terminals contain vesicles filled with these neurotransmitters. When an impulse (action potential) arrives at the axon terminal, it stimulates the movement of the synaptic vesicles towards the membrane where they fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The released neurotransmitters bind to their specific </span><span class="char-style-override-5">receptors</span><span>, present on the post-synaptic membrane. This binding opens ion channels allowing the entry of ions which can generate a new potential in the post-synaptic neuron. The new potential developed may be either excitatory or inhibitory.</span></div>

It controls the voluntary movements, balance of the body, functioning of vital involuntary organs (e.g., lungs, heart, kidneys, etc.), thermoregulation, hunger and thirst, circadian (24-hour) rhythms of our body, activities of several endocrine glands and human behaviour.  It is also the site for processing of vision, hearing, speech, memory, intelligence, emotions and thoughts. </div>

<div class="text"><span>T</span><span>he forebrain consists of </span><span class="char-style-override-5">cerebrum</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">thalamus</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">hypothalamus </span><span>(Figure 21.4). Cerebrum forms the major part of the human brain. A deep cleft divides the cerebrum longitudinally into two halves, which are termed as the left and right </span><span class="char-style-override-5">cerebral hemispheres</span><span>. The hemispheres are connected by a tract of nerve fibres called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">corpus callosum</span><span>. The layer of cells which covers the cerebral hemisphere is called cerebral cortex and is thrown into prominent folds. The cerebral cortex is referred to as the grey matter due to its greyish appearance. The neuron cell bodies are concentrated here giving the colour. The cerebral cortex contains motor areas, sensory areas and large regions that are neither clearly sensory nor motor in function. These regions called as the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">association areas </span><span>are responsible for complex functions like intersensory associations, memory and communication. Fibres of the tracts are covered with the myelin sheath, which constitute the inner part of cerebral hemisphere. They give an opaque white appearance to the layer and, hence, is called the white matter. The cerebrum wraps around a structure called thalamus, which is a major coordinating centre for sensory and motor signaling. Another very important part of the brain called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">hypothalamus</span><span> lies at the base of the thalamus. The hypothalamus contains a number of centres which control body temperature, urge for eating and drinking. It also contains several groups of neurosecretory cells, which secrete hormones called hypothalamic hormones. The inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures like amygdala, hippocampus, etc., form a complex structure called the limbic lobe or limbic system. Along with the hypothalamus, it is involved in the regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions (e.g., excitement, pleasure, rage and fear), and motivation.</span><span></span></div>

There are two types of photoreceptor cells, namely, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">rods</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">cones</span><span>. These cells contain the light-sensitive proteins called the photopigments. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and the twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The rods contain a purplish-red protein called the rhodopsin or visual purple, which contains a derivative of Vitamin A. In the human eye, there are three types of cones which possess their own characteristic photopigments that respond to red, green and blue lights. The sensations of different colours are produced by various combinations of these cones and their photopigments. When these cones are stimulated equally, a sensation of white light is produced.</span></div>

At the posterior pole of the eye lateral to the blind spot, there is a yellowish pigmented spot called macula lutea with a central pit called the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">fovea</span><span>.

Anatomically, the ear can be divided into three major sections called the outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear (Figure 21.7). The outer ear consists of the pinna and external auditory meatus (canal). The pinna collects the vibrations in the air which produce sound. The external auditory meatus leads inwards and extends up to the tympanic membrane (the ear drum). There are very fine hairs and wax-secreting glands in the skin of the pinna and the meatus. The tympanic membrane is composed of connective tissues covered with skin outside and with mucus membrane inside. The middle ear contains three ossicles called malleus, incus and stapes which are attached to one another in a chain-like fashion. The malleus is attached to the tympanic membrane and the stapes is attached to the oval window of the cochlea. The ear ossicles increase the efficiency of transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. An Eustachian tube connects the middle ear cavity with the pharynx. The Eustachian tube helps in equalising the pressures on either sides of the ear drum.</div><div class="summary"><div>

The bony labyrinth is a series of channels. Inside these channels lies the membranous labyrinth, which is surrounded by a fluid called perilymph. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a fluid called endolymph. The coiled portion of the labyrinth is called cochlea. The membranes constituting cochlea, the reissner’s and basilar, divide the surounding perilymph filled bony labyrinth into an upper scala vestibuli and a lower scala tympani (Figure 21.8). The space within cochlea called scala media is filled with endolymph. At the base of the cochlea, the scala vestibuli ends at the oval window, while the scala tympani terminates at the round window which opens to the middle ear.</div></span></div>

<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-18"><div class="summary">The organ of corti is a structure located on the basilar membrane which contains hair cells that act as auditory receptors. The hair cells are present in rows on the internal side of the organ of corti. The basal end of the hair cell is in close contact with the afferent nerve fibres. A large number of processes called stereo cilia are projected from the apical part of each hair cell. Above the rows of the hair cells is a thin elastic membrane called tectorial membrane.</div><div class="summary"><br/></div><div class="summary">The inner ear also contains a complex system called vestibular apparatus, located above the cochlea. The vestibular apparatus is composed of three semi-circular canals and the otolith (macula is the sensory part of saccule and utricle). Each semi-circular canal lies in a different plane at right angles to each other. The membranous canals are suspended in the perilymph of the bony canals. The base of canals is swollen and is called ampulla, which contains a projecting ridge called crista ampullaris which has hair cells. The saccule and utricle contain a projecting ridge called macula. The crista and macula are the specific receptors of the vestibular apparatus responsible for maintenance of balance of the body and posture.</div><div><br/></div></span></div>
<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-18"><h4 class="summary">20.6.2.1&#160;Mechanism of Hearing</h4><div class="summary">How does ear convert sound waves into neural impulses, which are sensed and processed by the brain enabling us to recognise a sound ? The external ear receives sound waves and directs them to the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates in response to the sound waves and these vibrations are transmitted through the ear ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) to the oval window. The vibrations are passed through the oval window on to the fluid of the cochlea, where they generate waves in the lymphs. The waves in the lymphs induce a ripple in the basilar membrane. These movements of the basilar membrane bend the hair cells, pressing them against the tectorial membrane. As a result, nerve impulses are generated in the associated afferent neurons. These impulses are transmitted by the afferent fibres via auditory nerves to the auditory cortex of the brain, where the impulses are analysed and the sound is recognised.</div></span></div>

<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-18"><div class="summary">The neural system coordinates and integrates functions as well as metabolic and homeostatic activities of all the organs. Neurons, the functional units of neural system are excitable cells due to a differential concentration gradient of ions across the membrane. The electrical potential difference across the resting neural membrane is called the ‘resting potential’. The nerve impulse is conducted along the axon membrane in the form of a wave of depolarisation and repolarisation. A synapse is formed by the membranes of a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron which may or may not be separated by a gap called synaptic cleft. Chemicals involved in the transmission of impulses at chemical synapses are called neurotransmitters.</div><div class="summary">Human neural system consists of two parts : (i) central neural system (CNS) and (ii) the peripheral neural system. The CNS consists of the brain and spiral cord. The brain can be divided into three major parts : (i) forebrain, (ii) midbrain and (iii) hindbrain. The forebrain consists of cerebrum, thalamus and hypothalamus. The cerebrum is longitudinally divided into two halves that are connected by the corpus callosum. A very important part of the forebrain called hypothalamus controls the body temperature, eating and drinking. Inner parts of cerebral hemispheres and a group of associated deep structures form a complex structure called limbic system which is concerned with olfaction, autonomic responses, regulation of sexual behaviour, expression of emotional reactions, and motivation. The midbrain receives and integrates visual, tactile and auditory inputs. The hindbrain comprises pons, cerebellum and medulla. The cerebellum integrates information received from the semicircular canals of the ear and the auditory system. The medulla contains centres, which control respiration, cardiovascular reflexes, and gastric secretions. Pons consist of fibre tracts that interconnect different regions of the brain. The entire process of involuntary response to a peripheral nervous stimulation is called reflex action.</div><div class="summary">Information regarding changes in the environment is received by the CNS through the sensory organs which are processed and analysed. Signals are then sent for necessary adjustments. The wall of the human eye ball is composed of three layers. The external layer is composed of cornea and sclera. Inside sclera is the middle layer, which is called the choroid. Retina, the innermost layer, contains two types of photoreceptor cells, namely rods and cones. The daylight (photopic) vision and colour vision are functions of cones and twilight (scotopic) vision is the function of the rods. The light enters through cornea, the lens and the images of objects are formed on the retina.</div></span></div>
