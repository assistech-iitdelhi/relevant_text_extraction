			<div class="text"><span>As you have read earlier, oxygen (O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>) is utilised by the organisms to indirectly break down simple molecules like glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, etc., to derive energy to perform various activities. Carbon dioxide (CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>) which is harmful is also released during the above catabolic reactions. It is, therefore, evident that O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>  has to be continuously provided to the cells and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2 </span><span>produced by the cells have to be released out. This process of exchange of O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> from the atmosphere with CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> produced by the cells is called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">breathing, </span><span>commonly known as </span><span class="char-style-override-4">respiration</span><span>. Place your hands on your chest; you can feel the chest moving up and down. You know that it is due to breathing. How do we breathe? The respiratory organs and the mechanism of breathing are described in the following sections of this chapter.</span></div>

			<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-5">17.1	Respiratory Organs</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>Mechanisms of breathing vary among different groups of animals depending mainly on their habitats and levels of organisation. Lower invertebrates like sponges, coelenterates, flatworms, etc., exchange O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> with CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> by simple diffusion over their entire body surface. Earthworms use their moist cuticle and insects have a network of tubes (tracheal tubes) to transport atmospheric air within the body. Special vascularised structures called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">gills </span><span>(branchial respiration) are used by most of the aquatic arthropods and molluscs whereas vascularised bags called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">lungs </span><span>(pulmonary respiration) are used by the terrestrial forms for the exchange of gases. Among vertebrates, fishes use gills whereas amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals respire through lungs. Amphibians like frogs can respire through their moist skin (cutaneous respiration) also.</span><span></span></div>

			<div class="text"><span>We have a pair of external nostrils opening out above the upper lips. It leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal chamber opens into the </span><span class="char-style-override-4">pharynx</span><span>, a portion of which is the common passage for food and air. The pharynx opens through the larynx region into the </span><span class="char-style-override-4">trachea</span><span>. Larynx is a cartilaginous box which helps in sound production and hence called the </span><span class="char-style-override-4">sound box</span><span>. During swallowing glottis can be covered by a thin elastic cartilaginous flap called epiglottis  to prevent the entry of food into the larynx. Trachea is a straight tube extending up to the mid-thoracic cavity, which divides at the level of 5th thoracic vertebra into a right and left primary </span><span class="char-style-override-4">bronchi</span><span>. Each bronchi undergoes repeated divisions to form the secondary and tertiary bronchi and bronchioles ending up in very thin terminal </span><span class="char-style-override-4">bronchioles</span><span>. The tracheae, primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi, and initial bronchioles are supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to a number of very thin, irregular-walled and vascularised bag-like structures called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">alveoli</span><span>. The branching network of bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli comprise the lungs (Figure 17.1). We have two lungs which are covered by a double layered pleura, with pleural fluid between them. It reduces friction on the lung-surface. The outer pleural membrane is in close contact with the thoracic &#160;lining whereas the inner pleural membrane is in contact with the lung surface. The part starting with the external nostrils up to the terminal bronchioles constitute the conducting part whereas the alveoli and their ducts form the respiratory or exchange part of the respiratory system. The conducting part transports the atmospheric air to the alveoli, clears it from foreign particles, humidifies and also brings the air to body temperature. Exchange part is the site of actual diffusion of O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> between blood and atmospheric air.</span></div>

			<h3 class="headingfinal"><span class="char-style-override-5">17.2	Mechanism of Breathing</span></h3>
			<div class="text"><span>Breathing involves two stages : </span><span class="char-style-override-4">inspiration </span><span>during which atmospheric air is drawn in and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">expiration </span><span>by which the alveolar air is released out. The movement of air into and out of the lungs is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between the lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration can occur if the pressure within the lungs (intra-pulmonary pressure) is less than the atmospheric pressure, i.e., there is a negative pressure in the lungs with respect to atmospheric pressure. Similarly, expiration takes place when the intra-pulmonary pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm and a specialised set of muscles – external and internal intercostals between the ribs, help in generation of such gradients. Inspiration is initiated by the contraction of diaphragm which increases the volume of thoracic chamber in the antero-posterior axis. The contraction of external inter-costal muscles lifts up the ribs and the sternum causing an increase in the volume of the thoracic chamber in the  dorso-ventral axis. The overall increase in the thoracic volume causes a similar increase in pulmonary volume. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intra-pulmonary pressure to less than the atmospheric pressure which forces the air from outside to move into the lungs, i.e., inspiration (Figure 17.2a). Relaxation of the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles returns the diaphragm and sternum to their normal positions and reduce the thoracic volume and thereby the pulmonary volume. This leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure to slightly above the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of air from the lungs, i.e., expiration (Figure 17.2b). We have the ability to increase the strength of inspiration and expiration with the help of additional muscles in the abdomen. On an average, a healthy human breathes 1</span><span>2</span><span>-</span><span>16 times/minute. The volume of air involved in breathing movements can be estimated by using a spirometer which helps in clinical assessment of pulmonary functions.</span></div>

Partial pressures of these two gases in the atmospheric air and the two sites of diffusion are given in Table 17.1 and in&#160;Figure 17.3. The data given in the table clearly indicates a concentration gradient for oxygen from alveoli to blood and blood to tissues.

O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> can bind with haemoglobin in a reversible manner to form </span><span class="char-style-override-4">oxyhaemoglobin</span><span>. Each haemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of  four molecules of O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>. Binding of oxygen with haemoglobin is primarily related to partial pressure of O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>. Partial pressure of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>, hydrogen ion concentration and temperature are the other factors which can interfere with this binding. A sigmoid curve is obtained when percentage saturation of haemoglobin with O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> is plotted against the pO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>. This curve is called the Oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 17.5) and is highly useful in studying the effect of factors like pCO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span>, H</span><span class="char-style-override-14">+</span><span> concentration, etc., on binding of O</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> with haemoglobin.

Another centre present in the pons region of the brain called pneumotaxic centre can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. Neural signal from this centre can reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiratory rate. A chemosensitive area is situated adjacent to the rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO</span><span class="char-style-override-3">2</span><span> and hydrogen ions. Increase in these substances can activate this centre, which in turn can signal the rhythm centre to make necessary adjustments in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated.

Exchange of O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of these gases throughout the body by blood, exchange of O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> between the oxygenated blood and tissues and utilisation of O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> by the cells (cellular respiration) are the other steps involved.</span></div>
			<div class="summary para-style-override-20">Inspiration and expiration are carried out by creating pressure gradients between the atmosphere and the alveoli with the help of specialised muscles – intercostals and diaphragm. Volumes of air involved in these activities can be estimated with the help of spirometer and are of clinical significance.</div>
			<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-16">Exchange of O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> at the alveoli and tissues occur by diffusion. Rate of diffusion is dependent on the partial pressure gradients of O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> (pO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16">) and CO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> (pCO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16">), their solubility as well as the thickness of the diffusion surface. These factors in our body facilitate diffusion of O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> from the alveoli to the deoxygenated blood as well as from the oxygenated blood to the tissues. The factors are favourable for the diffusion of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> in the opposite direction, i.e., from tissues to alveoli.</span></div>
			<div class="summary"><span class="char-style-override-16">Oxygen is transported mainly as oxyhaemoglobin. In the alveoli where pO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> is higher, O</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> gets bound to haemoglobin which is easily dissociated at the tissues where pO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> is low and pCO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> and H</span><span class="char-style-override-18">+</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> concentration are high. Nearly 70 per cent of carbon dioxide is transported as bicarbonate (HCO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">3</span><span class="char-style-override-18">–</span><span class="char-style-override-16">) with the help of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. 20-25 per cent of carbon dioxide is carried by haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin. In the tissues where pCO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> is high, it gets bound to blood whereas in the alveoli where pCO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2 </span><span class="char-style-override-16">is low and pO</span><span class="char-style-override-17">2</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> is high, it gets removed from the blood.</span></div>
