    <h4 class="Normal ParaOverride-8"><span class="CharOverride-5">12.1</span> <span class="CharOverride-6">Introduction</span></h4>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">In previous chapter we have studied thermal properties of matter. In this chapter we shall study laws that govern thermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is converted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub our palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing produces the ‘heat’. Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’ of the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons, which in turn rotate the wheels of the train.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-8">In physics, we need to define the notions of heat, temperature, work, etc. more carefully. Historically, it took a long time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the modern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid filling in the pores of a substance. On contact between a hot body and a cold body, the fluid (called caloric) flowed from the colder to the hotter bod</span><span class="CharOverride-8">y</span><span class="CharOverride-8">! This is similar to what happens when a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water up to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of water in the two tanks are the same. Likewise, in the ‘caloric’ picture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the temperatures) equalise.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-8">In time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in favour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An important experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin Thomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He observed that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of heat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the amount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the horses employed for turning the drill) but not on the sharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill would scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this was not observed. A most natural explanation of the observations was that heat was a form of energy and the experiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form to another–from work to heat.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-8">Th</span><span class="CharOverride-8">ermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms of energy. Thermodynamics is a macroscopic science. It deals with bulk systems and does not go into the molecular constitution of matter. In fact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the nineteenth century before the molecular picture of matter was firmly established. Thermodynamic description involves relatively few macroscopic variables of the system, which are suggested by common sense and can be usually measured directly. A microscopic description of a gas, for example, would involve specifying the co-ordinates and velocities of the huge number of molecules constituting the gas. The description in kinetic theory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve molecular distribution of velocities. Thermodynamic description of a gas, on the other hand, avoids the molecular description altogether. Instead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is specified by macroscopic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, mass and composition that are felt by our sense perceptions and are measurable</span><span class="CharOverride-9">*</span><span class="CharOverride-10">.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-8">The distinction between mechanics and thermodynamics is worth bearing in mind. In mechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles or bodies under the action of forces and torques. Thermodynamics is not concerned with the motion of the system as a whole. It is concerned with the internal macroscopic state of the body. When a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes is the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic energy, in particular), not its temperature. When the bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic energy of the bullet gets converted into heat, changing the temperature of the bullet and the surrounding layers of wood. Temperature is related to the energy of the internal (disordered) motion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet as a whole.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">Equilibrium in mechanics means</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">that the net external force and torque on a system are zero. The term ‘equilibrium’ in thermodynamics appears</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">in a different context : we say the state of a system is an equilibrium state if the macroscopic variables that characterise the system do not change in time. For example, a gas inside a closed rigid container, completely insulated from its surroundings, with fixed values of pressure, volume, temperature, mass and composition that do not change with time, is in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-8">In general, whether or not a system is in a state of equilibrium depends on the surroundings and the nature of the wall that separates the system from the surroundings.

The systems are insulated from the rest of the surroundings also by similar adiabatic walls. The situation is shown schematically in Fig. 12.1 (a). In this case, it is found that any possible pair of values (</span><span class="CharOverride-14">P</span><span class="CharOverride-15">A</span><span class="CharOverride-8">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">V</span><span class="CharOverride-15">A</span><span class="CharOverride-8">) will be in equilibrium with any possible pair of values (</span><span class="CharOverride-14">P</span><span class="CharOverride-15">B</span><span class="CharOverride-8">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">V</span><span class="CharOverride-15">B</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">).

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-16"><span class="CharOverride-8">Imagine two systems</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">A</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">and</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">B</span><span class="CharOverride-8">, separated by an adiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third system</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">C</span><span class="CharOverride-8">, via a conducting wall [Fig. 12.2(a)].

It is found that the states of</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">A</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">and</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">B</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">change no further i.e. they are found</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">to be in thermal equilibrium with each other</span><span class="CharOverride-8">. This observation forms the basis of the</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics</span><span class="CharOverride-8">, which states that</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other’</span><span class="CharOverride-8">. R.H. Fowler formulated this law in 1931 long after the first and second Laws of thermodynamics were stated and so numbered</span><span class="CharOverride-8">.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-8">The Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two systems</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">A</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">and</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">B,</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">are in thermal equilibrium, there must be a physical quantity that has the same value for both.

    <h4 class="Normal ParaOverride-18"><span class="CharOverride-5">12.4</span> <span class="CharOverride-6">Heat, internal energy and work</span></h4>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to the concept of temperature that agrees with our commonsense notion. Temperature is a marker of the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the direction of flow of heat when two bodies are placed in thermal contact. Heat flows from the body at a higher temperature to the one at lower temperature. The flow stops when the temperatures equalise; the two bodies are then in thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail how to construct temperature scales to assign temperatures to different bodies. We now describe the concepts of heat and other relevant quantities like internal energy and work.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-19"><span class="CharOverride-8">The concept of internal energy of a system is not difficult to understand. We know that every bulk system consists of a large number of molecules. Internal energy is simply the sum of the kinetic energies and potential energies of these molecules. We remarked earlier that in thermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the system, as a whole, is not relevant. Internal energy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and potential energies in the frame of reference relative to which the centre of mass of the system is at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered) energy associated with the random motion of molecules of the system. We denote the internal energy of a system by</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">U</span><span class="CharOverride-8">.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-19"><span class="CharOverride-8">Though we have invoked the molecular picture to understand the meaning of internal energy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned,</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">U</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">is simply a macroscopic variable of the system. The important thing about internal energy is that it depends only on the state of the system, not on how that state was achieved. Internal energy</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">U</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">of a system is an example of a thermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value depends only on the given state of the system, not on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive at that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given mass of gas depends on its state described by specific values of pressure, volume and temperature. It does not depend on how this state of the gas came about. Pressure, volume, temperature, and internal energy are thermodynamic state variables of the system (gas) (see section 12.7). If we neglect the small intermolecular forces in a gas, the internal energy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies associated with various random motions of its molecules. We will see in the next chapter that in a gas this motion is not only translational (i.e. motion from one point to another in the</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">volume of the container); it also includes rotational and vibrational motion of the molecules (Fig. 12.3).</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text-2 ParaOverride-20"><span class="CharOverride-12"><i>Fig. 12.4</i></span>&#160;&#160;<span class="CharOverride-13">Heat and work are two distinct modes of energy transfer to a system that results in change in its internal energy. (a) Heat is energy transfer due to temperature difference between the system and the surroundings. (b) Work is energy transfer brought about by means (e.g. moving the piston by raising or lowering some weight connected to it) that do not involve such a temperature difference.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-19"><span class="CharOverride-8">What are the ways of changing internal energy of a system ? Consider again, for simplicity, the system to be a certain mass of gas contained in a cylinder with a movable piston as shown in Fig. 12.4. Experience shows there are two ways of changing the state of the gas (and hence its internal energy). One way is to put the cylinder in contact with a body at a higher temperature than that of the gas. The temperature difference will cause a flow of energy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas, thus increasing the internal energy of the gas. The other way is to push the piston down i.e. to do work on the system, which again results in</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">increasing the internal energy of the gas. Of course, both these things could happen in the reverse direction. With surroundings at a lower temperature, heat would flow from the gas to the surroundings. Likewise, the g</span><span class="CharOverride-8">as could push the piston up and do work on the surroundings. In short, heat and work are two different modes of altering the state of a thermodynamic system and changing its internal energy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-19"><span class="CharOverride-8">The notion of heat should be carefully distinguished from the notion of internal energy. Heat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in transit. This is not just a play of words. The distinction is of basic significance. The state of a thermodynamic system is characterised by its internal energy, not heat. A statement like</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">‘a</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">gas in a given state has a certain amount of heat’</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">is as meaningless as the statement that</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount of work’</span><span class="CharOverride-8">.</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">In contrast,</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount of internal energy’</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">is a perfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the statements</span> <span class="CharOverride-5">‘a certain amount of heat is supplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount of work was done by the system’</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">are perfectly meaningful.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-19"><span class="CharOverride-8">To summarise, heat and work in thermodynamics are not state variables. They are modes of energy transfer to a system resulting in change in its internal energy, which, as already mentioned, is a state variable.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal ParaOverride-21"><span class="CharOverride-8">In ordinary language, we often confuse heat with internal energy. The distinction between them is sometimes ignored in elementary</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">physics books. For proper understanding of thermodynamics, however, the distinction is crucial.</span></p>

A thermodynamic system is not always in equilibrium. For example, a gas allowed to expand freely against vacuum is not an equilibrium state [Fig. 12.6(a)]. During the rapid expansion, pressure of the gas may</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">not be uniform throughout.

To decide which variable is extensive and which intensive, think of a relevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that it is divided into two equal parts. The variables that remain unchanged for each part are intensive. The variables whose values get halved in each part are extensive. It is easily seen, for example, that internal energy</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">U</span><span class="CharOverride-8">, volume</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">V</span><span class="CharOverride-8">, total ma</span><span class="CharOverride-8">ss</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">M</span> <span class="CharOverride-8">are extensive variables.

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">Consider a gas in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings. The pressure of the gas in that case equals the external pressure and its temperature is the same as that of its surroundings. Suppose that the external pressure is suddenly reduced (say by lifting the weight on the movable piston in the container). The piston will accelerate outward. During the process, the gas passes through states that are not equilibrium states. The non-equilibrium states do not have well-defined pressure and temperature. In the same way, if a finite temperature difference exists between the gas and its surroundings, there will be a rapid exchange of heat during which the gas will pass through non-equilibrium states. In due course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium state with well-defined temperature and pressure equal to those of the surroundings. The free expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture of gases undergoing an explosive chemical reaction, mentioned in section 12.7 are also examples where the system goes through non-equilibrium states.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-51"><span class="CharOverride-7">Non-equilibrium states of a system are difficult to deal with. It is, therefore, convenient to imagine an ideali</span><span class="CharOverride-7">sed process in which at every stage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">process is, in principle, infinitely slow, hence the name quasi-static (meaning nearly static). The system changes its variables (</span><span class="CharOverride-25">P</span><span class="CharOverride-7">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span><span class="CharOverride-7">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">V</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">) so slowly that it remains in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings throughout. In a quasi-static process, at every stage, the difference in the pressure of the system and the external pressure is infinitesimally small. The same is true of the temperature difference between the system and its surroundings (Fig.12.7). To take a gas from the state (</span><span class="CharOverride-25">P</span><span class="CharOverride-7">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">) to another state (</span><span class="CharOverride-25">P</span> <span class="CharOverride-26">′</span><span class="CharOverride-7">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span> <span class="CharOverride-26">′</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">) via a quasi-static process, we change the external pressure by a very small amount, allow the system to equalise its pressure with that of the surroundings and continue the process infinitely slowly until the system achieves the pressure</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">P</span> <span class="CharOverride-26">′</span><span class="CharOverride-7">.

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">A quasi-static process is obviously a hypothetical construct.

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">The First Law of Thermodynamics is the principle of conse</span><span class="CharOverride-7">rvation of energy. Common experience shows that there are many conceivable processes that are perfectly allowed by the First Law and yet are never observed. For example, nobody has ever seen a book lying on a table jumping to a height by itself. But such a thing would be possible if the principle of conservation of energy were the only restriction. The table could cool spontaneously, converting some of its internal energy into an equal amount of mechanical energy of the book, which would then hop to a height with potential energy equal to the mechanical energy it acquired. But this never happens. Clearly, some additional basic principle of nature forbids the above, even though it satisfies the energy conservation principle. This principle, which</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">disallows many phenomena consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics is known as the Second Law of Thermodynamics.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-24"><span class="CharOverride-7">The Second Law of Thermodynamics gives a fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a heat engine and the co-efficient of performance of a refrigerator. In simple terms, it says that efficiency of a heat engine can never be unity. According to Eq. (12.20), this implies that heat released to the cold reservoir can never be made zero. For a refrigerator, the Second Law says that the co-efficient of performance can never be infinite. According to Eq. (12.21), this implies that external work (</span><span class="CharOverride-25">W</span><span class="CharOverride-7">) can never be zero.

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-7">Imagine some process in which a thermodynamic system goes from an initial</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">state</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">i</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">to a final state</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">f</span><span class="CharOverride-7">. During the process the system absorbs heat</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">Q</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">from the surroundings and performs work</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">W</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">on it. Can we reverse this process and</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">bring both the system and surroundings to their initial states with no other effect anywhere ? Experience suggests that for most processes in nature this is not possible. The spontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. Several examples can be cited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter than its other parts. When the vessel is removed, heat is transferred from the base to the other parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform temperature (which in due course cools to the temperature of the surroundings). The process cannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not get cooler spontaneously and warm up the base. It will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics, if it did. The free expansion of a gas is irreversible. The combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol and air ignited by a spark cannot be reversed. Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the entire room. The diffusion process will not spontaneously reverse and bring the gas back to the cylinder. The stirring of a liquid in thermal contact with a reservoir will convert the work done into heat, increasing the internal energy of the reservoir. The process cannot be reversed exactly; otherwise it would amount to conversion of heat entirely into work, violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Irreversibility is a rule rather an exception in nature.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-24"><span class="CharOverride-7">Irreversibility arises mainly from two causes: one, many processes (like a free expansion, or an explosive chemical reaction) take the system to non-equilibrium states; two, most processes involve friction, viscosity and other dissipative effects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and losing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor and the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming to a stop due to viscosity and losing its mechanical energy with corresponding gain in the internal energy of the liquid). Since dissipative effects are present everywhere and can be minimised but not fully eliminated, most processes that we deal with are irreversible.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-24"><span class="CharOverride-7">A thermodynamic process (state</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">i</span> <span class="CharOverride-26">→</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">state</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">f</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">) is reversible if the process can be turned back such that both the system and the surroundings return to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe. From the preceding discussion, a reversible process is an idealised notion. A process is reversible only if it is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the surroundings at every stage) and there are no dissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston is a reversible process.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-78"><span class="CharOverride-7">Why is reversibility such a basic concept in thermodynamics ? As we have seen, one of the concerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency with which heat can be converted into work. The Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100% efficiency. But what is the highest efficiency possible for a heat engine working between two reservoirs at temperatures</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span><span class="CharOverride-30">1</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">and</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span><span class="CharOverride-30">2</span> <span class="CharOverride-7">? It turns out that a heat engine based on idealised reversible processes achieves the highest efficiency possible. All other engines involving irreversibility in any way (as would be the case for practical engines) have lower than this limiting efficiency.</span></p>

What is the maximum efficiency possible for a heat engine operating between the two reservoirs and what cycle of proces</span><span class="CharOverride-7">ses should be adopted to achieve the maximum efficiency ? Sadi Carnot, a French engineer, first considered this question in 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the correct answer, even though the basic concepts of heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly established.</span></p>

    <p class="Body-Text ParaOverride-78"><span class="CharOverride-7">We expect the ideal engine operating between two temperatures to be a reversible engine. Irreversibility is associated with dissipative effects, as remarked in the preceding section, and lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if it is quasi-static and non-dissipative. We have seen that a process is not quasi-static if it involves finite tem</span><span class="CharOverride-7">perature difference between the system and the reservoir. This implies that in a reversible heat engine operating between two temperatures, heat should be absorbed (from the hot reservoir) isothermally and released (to the cold reservoir) isothermally.

Which processes should we employ for this purpose that are reversible? A little reflection shows that we can only adopt reversible adiabatic processes for these purposes, which involve no heat flow from any reservoir. If we employ any other process that is not adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take the system from one temperature to another, we shall need a series of reservoirs in the temperature range</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span><span class="CharOverride-30"><sub>2</sub></span> <span class="CharOverride-7">to</span> <span class="CharOverride-25">T</span><span class="CharOverride-30"><sub>1</sub></span> <span class="CharOverride-7">to ensure that at each stage the process is quasi-static. (Remember again that for a process to be quasi-static and reversible, there should be no finite temperature difference between the system and the reservoir.) But we are considering a reversible engine that operates between only two temperatures.
