			<div class="Text">The history of civilisation is linked to the use of metals in antiquity in many ways. Different periods of early human civilisations have been named after metals. The skill of extraction of metals gave many metals and brought about several changes in the human society. It gave weapons, tools, ornaments, utensils, etc., and enriched the cultural life. The <span class="char-style-override-8">‘Seven metals of antiquity’</span>, as they are sometimes called, are gold, copper, silver, lead, tin, iron and mercury. Although modern metallurgy had exponential growth after Industrial Revolution, it is interesting to note that many modern concepts in metallurgy have their roots in ancient practices that pre-dated the Industrial Revolution. For over 7000 years, India has had a rich tradition of metallurgical skills. </div>
<div class="Text"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The two important sources for the history of Indian metallurgy are archaeological excavations and literary evidences. The first evidence of metal in Indian subcontinent comes from Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, where a small copper bead, dated to about 6000 BCE was found. It is however thought to be native copper, which has not been extracted from the ore. Spectrometric studies on copper ore samples obtained from the ancient mine pits at Khetri in Rajasthan and on metal samples cut from representative Harappan artefacts recovered from Mitathal in Haryana and eight other sites distributed in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra prove that copper metallurgy in India dates back to the Chalcolithic cultures in the subcontinent. Indian chalcolithic copper objects were in all probability made indigenously. The ore for extraction of metal for making the objects was obtained from chalcopyrite ore deposits in Aravalli Hills. Collection of archaeological texts from copper-plates and rock-inscriptions have been compiled and published by the Archaeological Survey of India during the past century. Royal records were engraved on copper plates <span class="char-style-override-9">(tamra-patra)</span>. Earliest known copper-plate has a Mauryan record that mentions famine relief efforts. It has one of the very few pre-Ashoka Brahmi inscriptions in India.</div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Harappans also used gold and silver, as well as their joint alloy electrum. Variety of ornaments such as pendants, bangles, beads and rings have been found in ceramic or bronze pots. Early gold and silver ornaments have been found from Indus Valley sites such as Mohenjodaro (3000 BCE). These are on display in the National Museum, New Delhi. India has the distinction of having the deepest ancient gold mines in the world, in the Maski region of Karnataka. Carbon dating places them in mid 1st millennium BCE.</div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span class="char-style-override-9">Hymns of Rigveda </span>give earliest indirect references to the alluvial placer gold deposits in India. The river Sindhu was an important source of gold in ancient times. It is interesting that the availability of alluvial placer gold in the river Sindhu has been reported in modern times also. It has been reported that there are great mines of gold in the region of Mansarovar and in Thokjalyug even now. The <span class="char-style-override-9">Pali</span> text, <span class="char-style-override-9">Anguttara Nikaya </span>narrates the process of the recovery of gold dust or particles from alluvial placer gold deposits. Although evidence of gold refining is available in Vedic texts, it is Kautilya’s <span class="char-style-override-9">Arthashastra</span>, authored probably in 3rd or 4th century BCE, during Mauryan era, which has much data on prevailing chemical practices in a long section on mines and minerals including metal ores of gold, silver, copper, lead, tin and iron. Kautilya describes a variety of gold called <span class="char-style-override-9">rasviddha</span>, which is naturally occurring gold solution. <span class="char-style-override-9">Kalidas</span> also mentioned about such solutions. It is astonishing how people recognised such solutions. </div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>The native gold has different colours depending upon the nature and amount of impurity present in it. It is likely that the different colours of native gold were a major driving force for the development of gold refining.</span></div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Recent excavations in central parts of Ganges Valley and Vindhya hills have shown that iron was produced there possibly as early as in 1800 BCE. In the recent excavations conducted by the Uttar Pradesh State Archaeological Department, iron furnaces, artefacts, tuyers and layers of slag have been found. Radiocarbon dating places them between BCE 1800 and 1000. The results of excavation indicate that the knowledge of iron smelting and manufacturing of iron artefacts was well known in Eastern Vindhyas and it was in use in the Central Ganga Plains, at least from the early 2nd millennium BCE. The quantity and types of iron artefacts and the level of technical advancements indicate that working of iron would have been introduced much earlier. The evidence indicates early use of iron in other areas of the country, which proves that India was indeed an independent centre for the development of the working of iron.  <span>   	</span>  </div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Iron smelting and the use of iron was especially established in South Indian megalithic cultures. The forging of wrought iron seems to have been at peak in India in the Ist millennium CE. Greek accounts report the manufacture of steel in India by crucible process. In this process, iron, charcoal and glass were mixed together in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. India was a major innovator in the production of advanced quality steel. Indian steel was called ‘the Wonder Material of the Orient’. A Roman historian, Quintus Curtius, records that one of the gifts Porus of Taxila (326 BCE) gave to Alexander the Great was some two-and-a-half tons of Wootz steel. Wootz steel is primarily iron containing a high proportion of carbon (1.0 – 1.9%). Wootz is the English version of the word <span class="char-style-override-9">‘ukku’</span> which is used for steel in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Literary accounts suggest that Indian Wootz steel from southern part of the Indian subcontinent was exported to Europe, China and Arab world. It became prominent in the Middle East where it was named as Damasus Steel. Michael Faraday tried to duplicate this steel by alloying iron with a variety of metals, including noble metals, but failed. </div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">When iron ore is reduced in solid state by using charcoal, porous iron blocks are formed. Therefore, reduced iron blocks are also called sponge iron blocks. Any useful product can be obtained from this material only after removing the porosity by hot forging. The iron so obtained is termed as wrought iron. An exciting example of wrought iron produced in ancient India is the world famous Iron Pillar. It was erected in its present position in Delhi in 5th century CE. The Sanskrit inscription engraved on it suggests that it was brought here from elsewhere during the Gupta Period. The average composition (weight%) of the components present in the wrought iron of the pillar, besides iron, are 0.15% C, 0.05% Si, 0.05% Mn, 0.25% P, 0.005% Ni, 0.03% Cu and 0.02% N. The most significant aspect of the pillar is that there is no sign of corrosion inspite of the fact that it has been exposed to the atmosphere for about 1,600 years. <span>  </span>  </div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>Radiocarbon dating</span> of charcoal from iron slag revealed evidence of continuous smelting in Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. The slag layer, which is dated to 353 BCE – CE 128, indicates that Khasi Hill region is the earliest iron smelting site studied in the entire region of North East India. The remnants of former iron-ore excavation and iron manufacturing are visible even now in the landscape of Khasi Hills. British naturalists who visited Meghalaya in early 19th century described the iron industry that had developed in the upper part of the Khasi Hills.  </div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">There is archaeological evidence of zinc production in Rajasthan mines at Zawar from the 6th or 5th BCE. India was the first country to master zinc distillation. Due to low boiling point, zinc tends to vapourise while its ore is smelted. Pure zinc could be produced after a sophisticated ‘downward’ distillation technique in which the vapour <span>was condensed in a lower container. This technique was also applied to mercury. Indian metallurgists were masters in this technique. This has been described in Sanskrit texts of 14th century.</span></div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><span><br/></span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>Indians had knowledge about mercury. They used it for medicinal purpose. Development of mining and metallurgy declined during the British colonial era. By the 19th century, once flourished mines of Rajasthan were mostly abandoned and became almost extinct. In 1947 when India got independence, European literature on science had already found its way slowly into the country. Thus, in post independence era, the Government of India initiated the process of nation building through the establishment of various institutes of science and technology. In the following sections, we will learn about the modern methods of extraction of elements.</span><span class="char-style-override-9"></span></div>

			<div class="Text"><span>A few elements like carbon, sulphur, gold and noble gases, occur in free state while others </span><span>are found in combined forms in the earth’s crust. Elements vary in abundance. Among metals, aluminium is the most abundant. In fact, it is the third most abundant element in earth’s crust (8.3% approx. by weight).

Many gemstones are impure forms of Al</span><span class="char-style-override-1">2</span><span>O</span><span class="char-style-override-1">3</span><span>. For example, gems ‘ruby’ and ‘sapphire’ have Cr and Co respectively as impurity. Iron is the second most abundant metal in the earth’s crust.

<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">An ore rarely contains only a desired substance. It is usually contaminated with earthly or undesired materials known as <span class="char-style-override-8">gangue</span>. The extraction and isolation of metals from ores involves the following major steps: </div>

It is therefore a type of <span class="char-style-override-9">gravity separation</span>. In one such process, an upward stream of running water is used to wash the powdered ore.

<div class="Text"><h4 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_6">6.2.2 Magnetic Separation</h4>
</div>
			<div class="Text">This is based on differences in magnetic properties of the ore components. If either the ore or the gangue is attracted towards magnetic field, then the separation is carried out by this method. For example iron ores are attracted towards magnet, hence, non–magnetic impurities can be separted from them using magnetic separation. The powdered ore is dropped over a conveyer belt which moves over a magnetic roller (Fig.6.1) Magnetic substance remains attracted towards the belt and falls close to it.&#160;</div>

<h4 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_7">Froth Floatation Method<br/></h4>
			<div class="Text">This method is used for removing gangue from sulphide ores. In this process, a suspension of the powdered ore is made with water.  <span class="char-style-override-9">Collectors</span> and <span class="char-style-override-9">froth stabilisers</span> are added to it. Collectors (e.g., pine oils, fatty acids, xanthates, etc.) enhance non-wettability of the mineral particles and froth stabilisers (e.g., cresols, aniline) stabilise the froth. </div>

			<div class="Para-Indent">Sometimes, it is possible to separate two sulphide ores by&#160;adjusting proportion of oil to water or by using ‘<span class="char-style-override-9">depressants</span>’.&#160;For example, in the case of an ore containing ZnS and PbS, the depressant used is NaCN.

<div class="Text-9-5">One can do wonders if he or she has a scientific temperament and is attentive to observations. A washerwoman had an innovative mind too. While washing a miner’s overalls, she noticed that sand and similar dirt fell to the bottom of the washtub. What was peculiar, the copper bearing compounds that had come to the clothes from the mines, were caught in the soapsuds and so they came to the top. One of her clients, Mrs. Carrie Everson was a chemist. The washerwoman told her experience to Mrs. Everson. The latter thought that the idea could be used for separating copper compounds from rocky and earth materials on large scale. This way an invention came up. At that time only those ores were used for extraction of copper, which contained large amounts of the metal. Invention of the&#160;<span class="char-style-override-9">Froth Floatation Method</span>&#160;made copper mining profitable even from the low-grade ores.

To understand the variation in the temperature required for thermal reductions and to predict which element will suit as the reducing agent for a given metal oxide (M<span class="char-style-override-1">x</span>O<span class="char-style-override-1">y</span>), Gibbs energy interpretations are made. The criterion for the feasibility of a thermal reduction is that at a given temperture Gibbs energy change of the reaction must be negative.

As the heater moves forward, the pure metal crystallises out of the melt left behind and the impurities pass on into the adjacent new molten zone created by movement of heaters. The process is repeated several times and the heater is moved in the same direction again and again. Impurities get concentrated at one end. This end is cut off.

			<div class="Text-9-5">Although modern metallurgy had exponential growth after Industrial Revolution, many modern concepts in metallurgy have their roots in ancient practices that predated the Industrial Revolution. For over 7000 years, India has had high tradition of metallurigical skills. Ancient Indian metallurgists have made major contributions which deserve their place in metallurgical history of the world. In the case of zinc and high–carbon steel, ancient India contributed significantly for the developemnt of base for the modern metallurgical advancements which induced metallurgical study leading to Industrial Revolution.</div>
			<div class="Text-9-5"><span>Metals are required for a variety of purposes. For this, we need their extraction from the minerals in which they are present and from which their extraction is commercially feasible.These minerals are known as </span><span class="char-style-override-8">ores</span><span>. Ores of the metal are associated with many impurities. Removal of these impurities to certain extent is achieved in </span><span class="char-style-override-8">concentration </span><span>steps. The concentrated ore is then treated chemically for obtaining the metal. Usually the metal compounds (e.g., oxides, sulphides) are reduced to the metal. The reducing agents used are carbon, CO or even some metals. In these reduction processes, the </span><span class="char-style-override-8">thermodynamic</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-8">electrochemical</span><span> concepts are given due consideration. The metal oxide reacts with a reducing agent; the oxide is reduced to the metal and the reducing agent is oxidised. In the two reactions, the net Gibbs energy change is negative, which becomes more negative on raising the temperature. Conversion of the physical states from solid to liquid or to gas, and formation of gaseous states favours decrease in the Gibbs energy for the entire system. This concept is graphically displayed in plots of </span><span class="char-style-override-13">∆</span><span>G</span><span class="char-style-override-20">0</span><span> vs T (Ellingham diagram) for such oxidation/reduction reactions at different temperatures. The concept of electrode potential is useful in the isolation of metals (e.g., Al, Ag, Au) where the sum of the two redox couples is positive so that the Gibbs energy change is negative. The metals obtained by usual methods still contain minor impurities. Getting pure metals requires </span><span class="char-style-override-8">refining</span><span class="char-style-override-9">. </span><span>Refining process depends upon the differences in properties of the metal and the impurities. Extraction of aluminium is usually carried out from its bauxite ore by leaching it with NaOH. Sodium aluminate, thus formed, is separated and then neutralised to give back the hydrated oxide, which is then electrolysed using cryolite as a flux. Extraction of iron is done by reduction of its oxide ore in blast furnace. Copper is extracted by smelting and heating in a reverberatory furnace. Extraction of zinc from zinc oxides is done using coke. Several methods are employed in refining the metal. Metals, in general, are very widely used and have contributed significantly in the development of a variety of industries.</span></div>
