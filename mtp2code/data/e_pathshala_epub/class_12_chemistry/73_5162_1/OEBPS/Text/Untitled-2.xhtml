			<div class="Text">From our earlier studies, we know that liquids and gases are called <span class="char-style-override-6">fluids</span> because of their ability to flow. The fluidity in both of these states is due to the fact that the molecules are free to move about. On the contrary, the constituent particles in solids have fixed positions and can only oscillate about their mean positions. This explains the rigidity in solids. These properties depend upon the nature of constituent particles and the binding forces operating between them. The correlation between structure and properties helps in the discovery of new solid materials with desired properties. For example, carbon nanotubes are new materials that have potential to provide material that are tougher than steel, lighter than aluminium and have more conductive property than copper. Such materials may play an expanding role in future development of science and society. Some other materials which are expected to play an important role in future are high temperature superconductors, magnetic materials, biodegradable polymers for packaging, biocompliant solids for surgical implants, etc. Thus, the study of this state becomes more important in the present scenario.</div>

At sufficiently low temperature, the thermal energy is low and intermolecular forces bring them so close that they cling to one another and occupy fixed positions. These can still oscillate about their mean positions and the substance exists in solid state.  The following are the characteristic properties of the solid state:</span></div>

<div class="Text"><span><h3 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_4">1.2 Amorphous and Crystalline Solids</h3></span></div>
<div class="Text"><span>Solids can be classified as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">crystalline</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-6">amorphous</span><span> o</span>n the basis of the nature of order present in the arrangement of their constituent particles.  A crystalline solid usually consists of a large number of small crystals, each of them having a definite characteristic geometrical shape. The arrangement of constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) in a crystal is ordered and repetitive in three dimensions. If we observe the pattern in one region of the crystal, we can predict accurately the position of particles in any other region of the crystal however far they may be from the place of observation. Thus, crystal has a long range order which means that there is a regular pattern of arrangement of particles which repeats itself periodically over the entire crystal.  Sodium chloride and quartz are typical examples of crystalline solids. Glass, rubber and many plastics do not form crystals when their liquids solidify on cooling. These are called amorphous solids. The term amorphous comes from the Greek word <span class="char-style-override-6">amorphos</span>, meaning no form.The arrangement of constituent particles (atoms, molecules or ions) in such a solid has only <span class="char-style-override-6">short range order</span>. In such an arrangement, a regular and periodically repeating pattern is observed over short distances only. Regular patterns are scattered and in between the arrangement is disordered. The structures of quartz (crystalline) and quartz glass (amorphous) are shown in Fig. 1.1 (a) and (b) respectively.  While the two structures are almost identical, yet in the case of amorphous quartz glass there is no <span class="char-style-override-6">long range order</span>. The structure of amorphous solids is similar to that of liquids. Due to the differences in the arrangement of the constituent particles, the two types of solids differ in their properties.</div>

			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>Crystalline solids have</span> a sharp melting point. At a characteristic temperature they melt abruptly and become liquid. On the other hand, amorphous solids soften, melt and start flowing over a range of temperature and can be moulded and blown into various shapes. Amorphous solids have the same structural features as liquids and are conveniently regarded as extremely viscous liquids. They may become crystalline at some temperature. Some glass objects from ancient civilisations are found to become milky in appearance because of some crystallisation. Like liquids, amorphous solids have a tendency to flow, though very slowly. Therefore, sometimes these are called <span class="char-style-override-6">pseudo solids</span> or <span class="char-style-override-6">super cooled</span> <span class="char-style-override-6">liquids</span>.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Amorphous solids are <span class="char-style-override-6">isotropic</span> in nature. Their properties such as mechanical strength, refractive index and electrical conductivity, etc., are same in all directions. It is because there is no <span class="char-style-override-6">long range </span>order in them and arrangement of particles is not definite along all the directions. Hence, the overall arrangement becomes equivalent in all directions. Therefore, value of any physical property would be same along&#160;any direction.</div>

			<div class="Para-Indent">Crystalline solids are <span class="char-style-override-7">anisotropic</span> in nature, that is, some of their physical properties like electrical resistance or refractive index show different values when measured along different directions in the same crystals. This arises from different arrangement of particles in different directions. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.2. This figure shows a simple two-dimensional pattern of arrangement of two kinds of atoms. Mechanical property such as resistance to shearing stress might be quite different in two directions indicated in the figure. Deformation in CD direction displaces row which has two different types of atoms while in AB direction rows made of one type of atoms are displaced. The differences between the crystalline solids and amorphous solids are summarised in Table 1.1.</div>

			<div class="Text">In Section 1.2, we have learnt about amorphous substances and that they have only short range order.  However, most of the solid substances are crystalline in nature. For example, all the metallic elements like iron, copper and silver; non-metallic elements like sulphur, phosphorus and iodine and compounds like sodium chloride, zinc sulphide and naphthalene form crystalline solids.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Crystalline solids can be classified in various ways. The method depends on the purpose in hand. Here, we will classify crystalline solids on the basis of nature of intermolecular forces or bonds that hold the constituent particles together. These are — (i) Van der waals forces;&#160;(ii) Ionic bonds; (iii) Covalent bonds; and (iv) Metallic bonds. On this basis, crystalline solids are classified into four categories viz., molecular, ionic, metallic and covalent solids.  Let us now learn about these categories.</div>

			<div class="Text">Molecules are the constituent particles of molecular solids. These are further sub divided into the following categories:</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(i)	</span><span class="char-style-override-6">Non polar Molecular Solids</span>:<span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>They comprise</span> either atoms, for example, argon and helium or the molecules formed by non polar covalent bonds, for example, H<span class="char-style-override-11">2</span>, Cl<span class="char-style-override-11">2</span> and I<span class="char-style-override-11">2</span>. In these solids, the atoms or molecules are held by weak dispersion forces or London forces about which you have learnt in Class XI. These solids are soft and non-conductors of electricity. They have low melting points and are usually in liquid or gaseous state at room temperature and pressure.</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(ii)	<span class="char-style-override-6">Polar Molecular Solids</span>:<span class="char-style-override-6"> </span>The molecules of substances like HCl, SO<span class="char-style-override-11">2, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">etc.</span> are formed by polar covalent bonds.

			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"></div>
			<div class="Text">Ions are the constituent particles of ionic solids. Such solids are formed by the three dimensional arrangements of cations and anions bound by strong coulombic (electrostatic) forces. These solids are hard and brittle in nature. They have high melting and boiling points. Since the ions are not free to move about, they are electrical insulators in the solid state. However,  in the molten state or when dissolved in water, the ions become free to move about and they conduct electricity. </div>
<div class="Text"><div class="Text"><br/></div>
<h4 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_8">1.3.3 Metallic Solids</h4>
</div>
			<div class="Text">Metals are orderly collection of positive ions surrounded by and held together by a sea of free electrons. These electrons are mobile and are evenly spread out throughout the crystal. Each metal atom contributes one or more electrons towards this sea of mobile electrons. These free and mobile electrons are responsible for high electrical and thermal conductivity of metals. When an electric field is applied, these electrons flow through the network of positive ions. Similarly, when heat is supplied to one portion of a metal, the thermal energy is uniformly spread throughout by free electrons. Another important characteristic of metals is their lustre and colour in certain cases. This is also due to the presence of free electrons in them. Metals are highly malleable and ductile. </div>
<div class="Text"><br/></div>
<div class="Text"><h4 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_9">1.3.4 Covalent or Network Solids</h4>
</div>
<div class="Text">A wide variety of crystalline solids of non-metals result from the formation of covalent bonds between adjacent atoms throughout the crystal. They are also called <span class="char-style-override-12">giant molecules</span>. Covalent bonds are strong and directional in nature, therefore atoms are held very strongly at their positions. Such solids are very hard and brittle. They have extremely high melting points and may even decompose before melting. They are insulators and do not conduct electricity. Diamond (Fig. 1.3) and silicon carbide are typical examples of such solids. Although Graphite (Fig. 1.4) also belongs to this class of crystals, but it is soft and is a conductor of electricity. Its exceptional properties are due to its typical structure. Carbon atoms are arranged in different layers and each atom is covalently bonded to three of its neighbouring atoms in the same layer. The fourth valence electron of each atom is present between different layers and is free to move about. These free electrons make graphite a good conductor of electricity. Different layers can slide one over the other. This makes graphite a soft solid and a good solid lubricant.</div>

<h3 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_10">1.4	Crystal Lattices and Unit Cells<br/></h3>
<div class="Text">You must have noticed that when tiles are placed to cover a floor, a repeated pattern is generated. If after setting tiles on floor we mark a point at same location in all the tiles (e.g. Centre of the tile) and see the marked positions only ignoring the tiles, we obtain a set of points. This set of points is the scaffolding on which pattern has been developed by placing tiles. This scaffolding is a space lattice on which two-dimensional pattern has been developed by placing structural units on its set of points (i.e. tile in this case). The structural unit is called basis or motif. When motifs are placed on points in space lattice, a pattern is generated. In crystal structure, motif is&#160;a molecule, atom or&#160;ion. A space lattice,&#160;also called a crystal lattice, is the pattern of points representing the locations of these motifs. In other words, space lattice is an abstract scaffolding for crystal structure. When we place motifs in an identical manner on points of space lattice, we get crystal structure. Fig. 1.5 shows a motif, a two-dimensional lattice and a hypothetical two-dimensional crystal structure obtained by placing motifs in the two-dimensional lattice.</div>

In this arrangement there is less free space and this packing is more efficient than the square close packing.

</div>
			<div class="Text para-style-override-1">Earlier in the section, we have learnt that when particles are close-packed resulting in either <span class="char-style-override-6">ccp </span>or <span class="char-style-override-6">hcp </span>structure, two types of voids are generated. While the number of octahedral voids present in a lattice is equal to the number of close packed particles, the number of tetrahedral voids generated is twice this number. In ionic solids, the bigger ions (usually anions) form the close packed structure and the smaller ions (usually cations) occupy the voids. If the latter ion is small enough then tetrahedral voids are occupied, if bigger, then octahedral voids. All octahedral or tetrahedral voids are not occupied. In a given compound, the fraction of octahedral or tetrahedral voids that are occupied, depends upon the chemical formula of the compound, as can be seen from the following examples.</div>

			<div class="Text">Although crystalline solids have short range as well as long range order in the arrangement of their constituent particles, yet crystals are not perfect.  Usually a solid consists of an aggregate of large number of small crystals.  These small crystals have defects in them.  This happens when crystallisation process occurs at fast or moderate rate.  Single crystals are formed when the process of crystallisation occurs at extremely slow rate.  Even these crystals are not free of defects. The defects are basically irregularities in the arrangement of constituent particles.  Broadly speaking, the defects are of two types, namely, <span class="char-style-override-6">point defects</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">line defects</span>. <span class="char-style-override-43">Point defects</span> are the irregularities or deviations from ideal arrangement around a point or an atom in a crystalline substance, whereas the <span class="char-style-override-43">line defects</span> are the irregularities or deviations from ideal arrangement in entire rows of lattice points.

The centred unit cells have additional particles at their body centre (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">body-centred</span><span class="char-style-override-27">), at the centre of each face (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">face-centred</span><span class="char-style-override-27">) or at the centre of two opposite faces (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">end-centred</span><span class="char-style-override-27">). There are seven types of </span><span class="char-style-override-60">primitive unit</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> cells. Taking centred unit cells also into account, there are fourteen types of unit cells in all, which result in fourteen </span><span class="char-style-override-60">Bravais lattices</span><span class="char-style-override-27">. </span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span class="char-style-override-60">Close-packing</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> of particles result in two highly efficient lattices, </span><span class="char-style-override-60">hexagonal</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> </span><span class="char-style-override-60">close-packed</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">hcp</span><span class="char-style-override-27">) and </span><span class="char-style-override-60">cubic close-packed</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">ccp</span><span class="char-style-override-27">). The latter is also called face-centred cubic (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">fcc</span><span class="char-style-override-27">) lattice. In both of these packings 74% space is filled. The remaining space is present in the form of two types of voids-octahedral voids and tetrahedral voids. Other types of packing are not close-packings and have less efficient packing of particles. While in </span><span class="char-style-override-60">body-centred</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> </span><span class="char-style-override-60">cubic lattice</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> (</span><span class="char-style-override-60">bcc</span><span class="char-style-override-27">) 68% space is filled, in simple cubic lattice only 52.4 % space is filled. </span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span class="char-style-override-27">Solids are not perfect in structure. There are different types of </span><span class="char-style-override-60">imperfections</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> or </span><span class="char-style-override-60">defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> in them. Point defects and line defects are common types of defects. Point defects are of three types - </span><span class="char-style-override-60">stoichiometric defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27">, </span><span class="char-style-override-60">impurity defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> and </span><span class="char-style-override-60">non-stoichiometric</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> </span><span class="char-style-override-60">defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27">. </span><span class="char-style-override-60">Vacancy defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> and </span><span class="char-style-override-60">interstitial defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> are the two basic types of stoichiometric point defects. In ionic solids, these defects are present as </span><span class="char-style-override-60">Frenkel</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> and </span><span class="char-style-override-60">Schottky defects</span><span class="char-style-override-27">. Impurity defects are caused by the presence of an impurity in the crystal. In ionic solids, when the ionic impurity has a different valence than the main compound, some vacancies are created. Non-stoichiometric defects are of </span><span class="char-style-override-60">metal excess type</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> and </span><span class="char-style-override-60">metal deficient type.</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> Sometimes calculated amounts of impurities are introduced by </span><span class="char-style-override-60">doping in semiconductors</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> that change their electrical properties. Such materials are widely used in electronics industry. Solids show many types of magnetic properties like </span><span class="char-style-override-60">paramagnetism</span><span class="char-style-override-27">, </span><span class="char-style-override-60">diamagnetism</span><span class="char-style-override-27">, </span><span class="char-style-override-60">ferromagnetism</span><span class="char-style-override-27">, </span><span class="char-style-override-60">antiferromagnetism</span><span class="char-style-override-27"> and </span><span class="char-style-override-60">ferrimagnetism</span><span class="char-style-override-27">. These properties are used in audio, video and other recording devices. All these properties can be correlated with their electronic configurations or structures.</span></div>
