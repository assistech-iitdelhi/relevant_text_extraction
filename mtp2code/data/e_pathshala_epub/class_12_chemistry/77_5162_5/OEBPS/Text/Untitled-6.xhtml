			<div class="Text">S<span>urface chemistry deals with phenomena that occur at the surfaces or interfaces. The interface or surface is represented by separating the bulk phases by a hyphen or a slash. For example, the interface between a solid and a gas may be represented by solid-gas or solid/gas. Due to complete miscibility, there is no interface between the gases. The bulk phases that we come across in surface chemistry may be pure compounds or solutions. The interface is normally a few molecules thick but its area depends on the size of the particles of bulk phases. Many important phenomena, noticeable amongst these being corrosion, electrode processes, heterogeneous catalysis, dissolution and crystallisation occur at interfaces. The subject of surface chemistry finds many applications in industry, analytical work and daily life situations.</span></div>

			</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Adsorption is essentially a surface phenomenon. Solids, particularly in finely divided state, have large surface area and therefore, charcoal, silica gel, alumina gel, clay, colloids, metals in finely divided state, etc. act as good adsorbents.</div>

The gas molecules concentrate at the surface of the charcoal, i.e., gases are adsorbed at the surface.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(ii)	In a solution of an organic dye, say methylene blue, when animal charcoal is added and the solution is well shaken, it is observed that the filtrate turns colourless. The molecules of the dye, thus, accumulate on the surface of charcoal, i.e., are adsorbed.</div>

			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>It is clear from the above examples that solid surfaces can hold the gas or liquid molecules by virtue of adsorption.

<div class="Para-Indent"><span><h4 class="Para-Indent" id="sigil_toc_id_5">5.1.1 Distinction between Adsorption and Absorption</h4></span></div>
			<div class="Text">In adsorption, the substance is concentrated only at the surface and does not penetrate through the surface to the bulk of the adsorbent, while in absorption, the substance is uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of the solid. For example, when a chalk stick is dipped in ink, the surface retains the colour of the ink due to adsorption of coloured molecules while the solvent of the ink goes deeper into the stick due to absorption. On breaking the chalk stick, it is found to be white from inside. A distinction can be made between absorption and adsorption by taking an example of water vapour. Water vapours are absorbed by anhydrous calcium chloride but adsorbed by silica gel. In other words, in adsorption the concentration of the adsorbate increases only at the surface of the adsorbent, while in absorption the concentration is uniform throughout the bulk of the solid.</div>
			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-7">
				<div class="Sub-Sub-Heading"><br/></div>
			</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span class="char-style-override-5">Both adsorption and absorption can take place simultaneously also. The term sorption is used to describe both the processes.</span><span> </span></div>
<h4 class="Para-Indent" id="sigil_toc_id_6"><span class="char-style-override-5">5.1.2	Mechanism of Adsorption<br/></span></h4>
			<div class="Text"><span>Adsorption arises due to the fact that the surface particles of the adsorbent are not in the same environment as the particles inside the bulk. Inside the adsorbent all the forces ac</span><span>ting between the particles are mutually balance</span><span>d but on the surface the particles are not surrounded by atoms or molecules of their kind on all sides, and hence they possess unbalanced or residual attractive forces. These forces of the adsorbent are responsible for attracting the adsorbate particles on its surface.The extent of adsorption increases with the increase of surface area per unit mass of the adsorbent at a given temperature and pressure.</span></div>
			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-8">
				<div class="Sub-Sub-Heading"><br/></div>
			</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>Another important factor featuring adsorption is the heat of adsorption. During adsorption, there is always a decrease in residual forces of the surface, i.e., there is decrease in surface energy which appears as heat. Adsorption, therefore, is invariably an exothermic process. In other words, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>H of adsorption is always negative. When a gas is adsorbed, the freedom of movement of its molecules become restricted. This amounts to decrease in the entropy of the gas after adsorption, i.e., </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>S is negative. Adsorption is thus accompanied by decrease in enthalpy as well as decrease in entropy of the system. For a process to be spontaneous, the thermodynamic requirement is that, at constant temperature and pressure, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>G must be negative, i.e., there is a decrease in Gibbs energy. On the basis of equation, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>G = </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>H – T</span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>S, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>G can be negative if </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>H has sufficiently high negative value as – T</span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>S is positive. Thus, in an adsorption process, which is spontaneous, a combination of these two factors makes </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>G negative. As the adsorption proceeds, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>H becomes less and less negative ultimately </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>H becomes equal to T</span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>S and </span><span class="char-style-override-6">∆</span><span>G becomes zero. At this state equ</span><span>ilibrium is attained.</span></div>

<h4 class="Para-Indent" id="sigil_toc_id_7">5.1.3	Types of Adsorption<span><br/></span></h4>
			<div class="Text"><span>There a</span><span>re mainly two types of adsorption of gases on solids.&#160;If accumulation of gas on the surface of a solid occurs on account of weak van der Waals’ forces, the adsorption is termed as </span><span class="char-style-override-2">physical adsorption or physisorption</span><span>. When the gas molecules or atoms are held to the solid surface by chemical bonds, the adsorption is termed </span><span class="char-style-override-2">chemical adsorption or chemisorption</span><span>. The chemical bonds may be covalent or ionic in nature. Chemisorption involves a high energy of activation and is, therefore, often referred to as activated adsorption. Sometimes these two processes occur simultaneously and it is not easy to ascertain the type of adsorption. A physical adsorption at low temperature may pass into chemisorption as the temperature is increased. For example, dihydrogen is first adsorbed on nickel by van der Waals’ forces. Molecules of hydrogen then dissociate to form hydrogen atoms which are held</span><span> on the surface by chemisorption.</span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Some of the important characteristics of both types of adsorption are described below:</div>
			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-9">

			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(i)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">L</span><span class="char-style-override-7">ack of specificity:</span><span> A given surface of an adsorbent does not show any preference for a particular gas as the van der Waals’ forces are universal.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(ii)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Nature of adsorbate:</span><span> The amount of gas adsorbed by a solid depends on the nature of gas. In general, easily liquefiable gases (i.e., with higher critical temperatures) are readily adsorbed as van der Waals’ forces are stronger near the critical temperatures. Thus, 1g of activated charcoal adsorbs more sulphur dioxide (critical temperature 630K), than methane (critical temperature 190K) which is still more t</span><span>han 4.5 mL of dih</span>ydrogen (critical temperature 33K).</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(iii)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Reversible nature:</span><span> Physical adsorption of a gas by a solid is generally reversible. Thus,</span></div>
			<div class="Text"><span>		Solid + Gas </span><span class="char-style-override-8">l</span> Gas/Solid + Heat</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>			</span><span>More of gas is adsorbed when pressure is increased as the volume of the gas decreases (Le–Chateliers’s principle) and the gas can be removed by decreasing pressure. Since the adsorption process is exothermic, the physical adsorption occurs readily at low temperature and decreases with increasing temperature <br/>(Le-Chatelier’s principle). </span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(iv)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Surface area of adsorbent:</span><span> The extent of adsorption increases with the increase of surface area of the adsorbent. Thus, finely divided metals and porous substances having large surface areas are good adsorbents.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(v)</span><span class="char-style-override-2">	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Enthalpy of adsorption:</span><span> No doubt, physical adsorption is an exothermic process but its enthalpy of adsorption is quite low (20–40 kJ mol</span><span class="char-style-override-1">-1</span><span>). This is because the attraction between gas molecules and solid surface is only due to weak van der Waals’ forces.</span></div>
			<div class="Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading">Characteristics of chemisorption</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(i)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">High specificity:</span><span> Chemisorption is highly specific and it will only occur if there is some possibility of chemical bonding between adsorbent and adsorbate. For example, oxygen is adsorbed on metals by virtue of oxide formation and hydrogen is adsorbed by transition metals due to hydride formation.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(ii)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Irreversibility:</span><span> As chemisorption involves compound formation, it is usually irreversible in nature. Chemisorption is also an exothermic process but the process is very slow at low temperatures on account of high energy of activation. Like most chemical changes, adsorption often increases with rise of temperature. Physisorption of a gas adsorbed at low temperature  may change into chemisorption at a high temperature. Usually high pressure is also favourable for chemisorption.</span></div>

</div>
<div class="Indent--i----ii-">	One of the reactants is in liquid state and the other in gaseous state while the catalyst is in the solid state.</div>
			<div class="Text">This theory explains the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis. The old theory, known as adsorption theory of catalysis, was that the reactants in gaseous state or in solutions, are adsorbed on the surface of the solid catalyst. The increase in concentration of the reactants on the surface increases the rate of reaction. Adsorption being an exothermic process, the heat of adsorption is utilised in enhancing the rate of the reaction.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The catalytic action can be explained in terms of the intermediate compound formation, the theory of which you have already studied in Section 4.5.1</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The modern adsorption theory is the combination of intermediate compound formation theory and the old adsorption theory. The catalytic activity is localised on the surface of the catalyst. The mechanism involves five steps:</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(i)	Diffusion of reactants to the surface of the catalyst.</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(ii)	Adsorption of reactant molecules on the surface of the catalyst.</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(iii)	Occurrence of chemical reaction on the catalyst’s surface through formation of an intermediate (Fig. 5.3).</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(iv)	Desorption of reaction products from the catalyst surface, and thereby, making the surface available again for more reaction to occur.</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(v)	Diffusion of reaction products away from the catalyst’s surface. The surface of the catalyst unlike the inner part of the bulk, has free valencies which provide the seat for chemical forces of attraction. When a gas comes in contact with such a surface, its molecules are held up there due to loose chemical combination. If different molecules are adsorbed side by side, they may react with each other resulting in the formation of new molecules. Thus, formed molecules may evaporate leaving the surface for the fresh reactant molecules.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">This theory explains why the catalyst remains unchanged in mass and chemical composition at the end of the reaction and is effective even in small quantities. It however, does not explain the action of catalytic promoters and catalytic poisons.</div>

			<div class="Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading">(a)	Activity</div>
			<div class="Text para-style-override-6">	The activity of a catalyst depends upon the strength of chemisorption to a large extent. The reactants must get adsorbed reasonably strongly on to the catalyst to become active. However, they must not get adsorbed so strongly that they are immobilised and other reactants are left with no space on the catalyst’s surface for adsorption. It has been found that for hydrogenation reaction, the catalytic activity increases from Group 5 to Group 11 metals with maximum activity being shown by groups 7-9 elements of the periodic table (Class XI, Unit 3).</div>

			<div class="Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading">(b)	Selectivity</div>
			<div class="Text para-style-override-6">	The selectivity of a catalyst is its ability to direct a reaction to yield a particular product selectively, when under the same reaction conditions many products are possible. Selectivity of different catalysts for same reactants is different. For example, starting with H<span class="char-style-override-4">2</span> and CO, and using different catalysts, we get different products.</div>

			</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"></div>
			<div class="Text">Depending upon the nature of interaction between the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, colloidal sols are divided into two categories, namely, <span class="char-style-override-2">lyophilic</span> (solvent attracting) and <span class="char-style-override-2">lyophobic</span> (solvent repelling). If water is the dispersion medium, the terms used are hydrophilic and hydrophobic.</div>
<div class="Text"><br/></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(i)	<span class="char-style-override-7">Lyophilic colloids</span>: The word ‘lyophilic’ means liquid-loving. Colloidal sols directly formed by mixing substances like gum, gelatine, starch, rubber, etc., with a suitable liquid (the dispersion medium) are called lyophilic sols. An important characteristic of these sols is that if the dispersion medium is separated from the dispersed phase (say by evaporation), the sol can be reconstituted by simply remixing with the dispersion medium. That is why these sols are also called <span class="char-style-override-2">reversible sols</span>. Furthermore, these sols are quite stable and cannot be easily coagulated as discussed later.</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(ii)	<span class="char-style-override-7">Lyophobic colloids</span>: The word ‘lyophobic’ means liquid-hating. Substances like metals, their sulphides, etc., when simply mixed with the dispersion medium do not form the colloidal sol. Their colloidal sols can be prepared only by special methods (as discussed later). Such sols are called lyophobic sols. These sols are readily precipitated (or coagulated) on the addition of small amounts of electrolytes, by heating or by shaking and hence, are not stable. Further, once precipitated, they do not give back the colloidal sol by simple addition of the dispersion medium. Hence, these sols are also called <span class="char-style-override-2">irreversible sols</span>. Lyophobic sols need stabilising agents for their preservation.</div>

<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><br/></div>
<div class="Text"><span>Depending upon the type of the particles of the dispersed phase, colloids are classified as: multimolecular, macromolecular and associated colloids.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(i)	<span class="char-style-override-7">Multimolecular colloids</span>: On dissolution, a large number of atoms or smaller molecules of a substance aggregate together to form species having size in the colloidal range (1–1000 nm). The species thus formed are called multimolecular colloids. For example, a gold sol may contain particles of various sizes having many atoms. Sulphur sol consists of particles containing a thousand or more of S<span class="char-style-override-4">8</span> sulphur molecules.</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	<span>(ii)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Macromolecular colloids</span><span>: Macromolecules (Unit 15) in suitable solvents form solutions in which the size of the macromolecules </span>may be in the colloidal range.

Examples of naturally occurring macromolecules are starch, cellulose, proteins and enzymes; and those of man-made macromolecules are polythene, nylon, polystyrene, synthetic rubber, etc.</div>
<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><br/></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-">	(iii)	<span class="char-style-override-7">Associated colloids (Micelles)</span>: There are some substances which at low concentrations behave as normal strong electrolytes, but at higher concentrations exhibit colloidal behaviour due to the formation of aggregates. The aggregated particles thus formed are called <span class="char-style-override-2">micelles</span>. These are also known as <span class="char-style-override-2">associated colloids</span>.

On dilution, these colloids revert back to individual ions. Surface active agents such as soaps and synthetic detergents belong to this class. For soaps, the CMC is 10<span class="char-style-override-1">–4</span> to 10<span class="char-style-override-1">–3</span> mol L<span class="char-style-override-1">–1</span>. These colloids have both lyophobic and lyophilic parts. Micelles may contain as many as 100 molecules or more. <span class="char-style-override-2"></span></div>

			<div class="Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading">Mechanism of micelle formation</div>
<div class="Text">Let us take the example of soap solutions.

The RCOO<span class="char-style-override-1">–</span> ions, however, consist of two parts — a long hydrocarbon chain R (also called non-polar ‘tail’) which is hydrophobic (water repelling), and a polar group COO<span class="char-style-override-1">–</span> (also called polar-ionic ‘head’), which is hydrophilic (water loving). </div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>The RCOO</span><span class="char-style-override-1">–</span> ions are, therefore, present on the surface with their COO<span class="char-style-override-1">–</span> groups in water and the hydrocarbon chains R staying away from it and remain at the surface.

			<div class="Text">It has been mentioned earlier that a micelle consists of a hydrophobic hydrocarbon – like central core. The cleansing action of soap is due to the fact that soap molecules form micelle around the oil droplet in such a way that hydrophobic part of the stearate ions is in the oil droplet and hydrophilic part projects out of the grease droplet like the bristles (Fig. 5.7). Since the polar groups can interact with water, the oil droplet surrounded by stearate ions is now pulled in water and removed from the dirty surface. Thus soap helps in emulsification and washing away of oils and fats. The negatively charged sheath around the globules prevents them from coming together and forming aggregates.</div>

For example, a mixture of milk and water appears blue when viewed by the reflected light and red when viewed by the transmitted light. Finest gold sol is red in colour; as the size of particles increases, it appears purple, then blue and finally golden.</span></div>

This motion was first observed by the British botanist, Robert Brown, and is known as Brownian movement (Fig. 5.12). This motion is independent of the nature of the colloid but depends on the size of the particles and viscosity of the solution. Smaller the size and lesser the viscosity, faster is the motion.</span></div>

			<div class="Para-Indent">The presence of equal and similar charges on colloidal particles is largely responsible in providing stability to the colloidal solution, because the repulsive forces between charged particles having same charge prevent them from coalescing or aggregating when they come closer to one another.&#160;</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The charge on the sol particles is due to one or more reasons, viz., due to electron capture by sol particles during electrodispersion of metals, due to preferential adsorption of ions from solution and/or due to formulation of electrical double layer.

			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>The combination of the two layers of opposite charges around the colloidal particle is called Helmholtz electrical double layer. According to modern views, the first layer of ions is firmly held and is termed fixed layer while the second layer is mobile which is termed diffused layer. Fig. 5.13 depicts the formation of double layer. Since separation of charge is a seat of potential, the charges of opposite signs on the fixed and diffused parts of the double layer results in a difference in potential between these layers in the same manner as potential difference is developed in a capacitor. This potential difference between the fixed layer and the diffused layer of opposite charges is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-2">electrokinetic potential or zeta potential</span><span>.</span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">If two particles of an insoluble material (precipitate) do not have double layers they can come close enough and attractive van der Waals forces pull them together. When particles possess double layer as shown in Fig. 5.13, the overall effect is that particles repel each other at large distances of separation. This repulsion prevents their close approach. They remain dispersed and colloid is stabilised.</div>

			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>(vii) </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Coagulation or precipitation</span><span>: The stability of the lyophobic sols is due to the presence of charge on colloidal particles. If, somehow, the charge is removed, the particles will come nearer to each other to form aggregates (or coagulate) and settle down under the force of gravity.</span></div>
			<div class="Text"><span class="char-style-override-2">The process of settling of colloidal particles is called coagulation or precipitation of the sol</span><span>.</span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The coagulation of the lyophobic sols can be carried out in the following ways:</div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(i)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">By electrophoresis</span><span>: The colloidal particles move towards oppositely charged electrodes, get discharged and precipitated.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(ii)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">By mixing two oppositely charged sols</span><span>: Oppositely charged sols when mixed in almost equal proportions, neutralise their charges and get partially or completely precipitated. Mixing of hydrated ferric oxide (+ve sol) and arsenious sulphide (–ve sol) bring them in the precipitated forms. This type of coagulation is called mutual coagulation.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(iii)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">By boiling</span><span>: When a sol is boiled, the adsorbed layer is disturbed due to increased collisions with the molecules of dispersion medium. This reduces the charge on the particles and ultimately leads to settling down in the form of a precipitate.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(iv)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">By persistent dialysis</span><span>: On prolonged dialysis, traces of the electrolyte present in the sol are removed almost completely and the colloids become unstable and ultimately coagulate.</span></div>
			<div class="x-i----ii----iii-"><span>	(v)	</span><span class="char-style-override-7">By addition of electrolytes</span><span>: When excess of an electrolyte is added, the colloidal particles are precipitated. The reason is that colloids interact with ions carrying charge opposite to that present on themselves. This causes neutralisation leading to their coagulation. The ion responsible for neutralisation of charge on the particles is called the coagulating ion. A negative ion causes the precipitation of positively charged sol and vice versa.</span></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>It has been observed that, generally, the greater the valence of the flocculating ion added, the greater is its power to cause precipitation. This is known as Hardy-Schulze rule.

			<div class="Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading">Coagulation of lyophilic sols</div>
<div class="Text">There are two factors which are responsible for the stability of lyophilic sols. These factors are the charge and solvation of the colloidal particles. When these two factors are removed, a lyophilic sol can be coagulated. This is done (i) by adding an electrolyte and (ii) by adding a suitable solvent. When solvents such as alcohol and acetone are added to hydrophilic sols, the dehydration of dispersed phase occurs. Under this condition, a small quantity of electrolyte can bring about coagulation.</div>
			<div class="Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading">Protection of colloids </div>
			<div class="Text">Lyophilic sols are more stable than lyophobic sols. This is due to the fact that lyophilic colloids are extensively solvated, i.e., colloidal particles are covered by a sheath of the liquid in which they are dispersed.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Lyophilic colloids have a unique property of protecting lyophobic colloids. When a lyophilic sol is added to the lyophobic sol, the lyophilic particles form a layer around lyophobic particles and thus protect the latter from electrolytes. Lyophilic colloids used for this purpose are called protective colloids.</div>

			<div class="Para-Indent">Emulsions of oil in water are unstable and sometimes they separate into two layers on standing. For stabilisation of an emulsion, a third component called emulsifying agent is usually added. The emulsifying agent forms an interfacial film between suspended particles and the medium. The principal emulsifying agents for O/W emulsions are proteins, gums, natural and synthetic soaps, etc., and for W/O, heavy metal salts of fatty acids, long chain alcohols, lampblack, etc.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Emulsions can be diluted with any amount of the dispersion medium. On the other hand, the dispersed liquid when mixed, forms a separate layer. The droplets in emulsions are often negatively charged and can be precipitated by electrolytes. They also show Brownian movement and Tyndall effect. Emulsions can be broken into constituent liquids by heating, freezing, centrifuging, etc.</div>
