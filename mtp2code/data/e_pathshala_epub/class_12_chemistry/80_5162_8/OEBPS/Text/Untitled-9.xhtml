<h3 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_4">8.2	Electronic Configurations&#160;of the d-Block&#160;Elements<br/></h3>

The (n–1) stands for the inner <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> orbitals which may have one to ten electrons and the outermost n<span class="char-style-override-4">s</span> orbital may have one or two electrons. However, this generalisation has several exceptions because of very little energy difference between (n-1)<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> and n<span class="char-style-override-4">s</span> orbitals. Furthermore, half and completely filled sets of orbitals are relatively more stable. A consequence of this factor is reflected in the electronic configurations of Cr and Cu in the 3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> series. For example, consider the case of Cr, which has 3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">5 </span>4<span class="char-style-override-4">s</span><span class="char-style-override-6">1</span> configuration instead of 3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">4</span>4<span class="char-style-override-4">s</span><span class="char-style-override-6">2</span>; the energy gap between the two sets (3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> and 4<span class="char-style-override-4">s</span>) of orbitals is small enough to prevent electron entering the 3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> orbitals.

</div>
</div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
<div class="Para-Indent">The transition metals (with the exception of Zn, Cd and Hg) are very hard and have low volatility. Their melting and boiling points are high. Fig. 8.1 depicts the melting points of transition metals belonging to 3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span>, 4<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> and 5<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> series. The high melting points of these metals are attributed to the involvement of greater number of electrons from (n-1)<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> in addition to the n<span class="char-style-override-4">s</span> electrons in the interatomic metallic bonding. In any row the melting points of these metals rise to a maximum at <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">5</span> except for anomalous values of Mn and Tc and fall regularly as the atomic number increases.  They have high enthalpies of atomisation which are shown in Fig. 8.2.  The maxima at about the middle of each series indicate that one unpaired electron per <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> orbital is particularly favourable for strong interatomic interaction. In general, greater the number of valence electrons, stronger is the resultant bonding. Since the enthalpy of atomisation is an important factor in determining the standard electrode potential of a metal, metals with very high enthalpy of atomisation (i.e., very high boiling point) tend to be noble in their reactions (see later for electrode potentials).</div>
<div class="Para-Indent"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">Another generalisation that may be drawn from Fig. 8.2 is that the metals of the second and third series have greater enthalpies of atomisation than the corresponding elements of the first series; this is an important factor in accounting for the occurrence of much more frequent metal – metal bonding in compounds of the heavy transition metals.</div>

<h4 class="Text" id="sigil_toc_id_7">8.3.2	Variation in Atomic and Ionic Sizes of Transition Metals<br/></h4>
<div class="Text">In general, ions of the same charge in a given series show progressive decrease in radius with increasing atomic number. This is because the new electron enters a <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> orbital each time the nuclear charge increases by unity. It may be recalled that the shielding effect of a <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> electron is not that effective, hence the net electrostatic attraction between the nuclear charge and the outermost electron increases and the ionic radius decreases. The same trend is observed in the atomic radii of a given series. However, the variation within a series is quite small. An interesting point emerges when atomic sizes of one series are compared with those of the corresponding elements in the other series. The curves in Fig. 8.3 show an increase from the first (3<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span>) to the second (4<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span>) series of the elements but the radii of the third (5<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span>) series are virtually the same as those of the corresponding members of the second series. This phenomenon is associated with the intervention of the 4<span class="char-style-override-4">f</span> orbitals which must be filled before the 5<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> series of elements begin. The filling of 4<span class="char-style-override-4">f</span> before 5<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> orbital results in a regular decrease in atomic radii called <span class="char-style-override-13">Lanthanoid contraction</span> which essentially compensates for the expected increase in atomic size with increasing atomic number. The net result of the lanthanoid contraction is that the second and the third <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> series exhibit similar radii (e.g., Zr 160 pm, Hf 159 pm) and have very similar physical and chemical properties much more than that expected on the basis of usual family relationship.</div>
<div class="Text"><br/></div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The factor responsible for the lanthanoid contraction is somewhat similar to that observed in an ordinary transition series and is attributed to similar cause, i.e., the imperfect shielding of one electron by another in the same set of orbitals. However, the shielding of one 4<span class="char-style-override-4">f</span> electron by another is less than that of one <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span> electron by another, and as the nuclear charge increases along the series, there is fairly regular decrease in the size of the entire 4<span class="char-style-override-4">f </span><span class="char-style-override-6">n</span> orbitals.</div>

			</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">There is an increase in ionisation enthalpy along each series of the transition elements from left to right&#160;due to an increase in nuclear charge which accompanies the filling of the inner&#160;<span class="char-style-override-4">d</span>&#160;orbitals. Table 8.2 gives the values of the first three ionisation enthalpies of the first series of transition elements. These values show that the successive enthalpies of these elements do not increase as steeply as in the case of non-transition elements. The variation in ionisation enthalpy along a series of transition elements is much less in comparison to the variation along a period of non-transition elements. The first ionisation enthalpy, in general, increases, but the magnitude of the increase in the second and third ionisation enthalpies for the successive elements, is much higher along a series.<span><br/></span></div>

<div class="Para-Indent"><span>The irregular trend in the first ionisation enthalpy of the metals of 3</span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> series, though of little chemical significance, can be accounted for by considering that the removal of one electron alters the relative energies of 4</span><span class="char-style-override-4">s</span><span> and 3</span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> orbitals. You have learnt that when </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span>-block elements form ions, </span><span class="char-style-override-4">ns</span><span> electrons are lost before (</span><span class="char-style-override-4">n</span><span> – 1) </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d </span><span>electrons.

These 3</span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> electrons shield the 4</span><span class="char-style-override-4">s</span><span> electrons from the increasing nuclear charge somewhat more effectively than the outer shell electrons can shield one another. Therefore, the atomic radii decrease less rapidly. Thus, ionization energies increase only slightly along the 3</span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> series. The doubly or more highly charged ions have </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">n</span><span> configurations with no 4</span><span class="char-style-override-4">s</span><span> electrons. A general trend of increasing values of second ionisation enthalpy is expected as the effective nuclear charge increases because one </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> electron does not shield another electron from the influence of nuclear charge because </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span>-orbitals differ in direction.</span><span class="char-style-override-13"> </span>However, the trend of steady increase in second and third ionisation enthalpy breaks for the formation of Mn<span class="char-style-override-6">2+</span> and Fe<span class="char-style-override-6">3+</span> respectively. In both the cases, ions have <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">5</span> configuration. Similar breaks occur at corresponding elements in the later transition series.</div>
			<div class="Para-Indent">The interpretation of variation in ionisation enthalpy for an electronic configuration <span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-27">n</span> is as follows:</div>

			<div class="Para-Indent">The three terms responsible for the value of ionisation enthalpy are attraction of each electron towards nucleus, repulsion between the <span>electrons and the exchange energy. Exchange energy is responsible for the stabilisation of energy state. Exchange energy is approximately proportional to the total number of possible pairs of parallel spins in the degenerate orbitals. When several electrons occupy a set of degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy state corresponds to the maximum possible extent of single occupation of orbital and parallel spins (Hunds rule). The loss of exchange energy increases the stability. As the stability increases, the ionisation becomes more difficult. There is no loss of exchange energy at </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">6</span><span> configuration.

In the same way, Fe</span><span class="char-style-override-6">2+</span><span> has </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">6</span><span> configuration and Mn</span><span class="char-style-override-28">2+</span><span> has 3</span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">5</span><span> configuration. Hence, ionisation enthalpy of Fe</span><span class="char-style-override-6">2+</span><span> is lower than the Mn</span><span class="char-style-override-6">2+</span><span>. In other words, we can say that the third ionisation enthalpy of Fe is lower than that of Mn.</span></div>

To form the M</span><span class="char-style-override-6">2+</span><span> ions from the gaseous atoms, the sum of the first and second ionisation enthalpy is required in addition to the enthalpy of atomisation. The dominant term is the second ionisation enthalpy which shows unusually high values for Cr and Cu where M</span><span class="char-style-override-6">+</span><span> ions have the </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">5</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span class="char-style-override-6">10</span><span> configurations respectively.

			<div class="Para-Indent"><span>The elements which give the greatest number of oxidation states occur in or near the middle of the series. Manganese, for example, exhibits all the oxidation states from +2 to +7. The lesser number of oxidation states at the extreme ends stems from either too few electrons to lose or share (Sc, Ti) or too many </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> electrons (hence fewer orbitals available in which to share electrons with others) for higher valence (Cu, Zn). Thus, early in the series scandium(II) is virtually unknown and titanium (IV) is more stable than Ti(III) or Ti(II). At the other end, the only oxidation state of zinc is +2 (no </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> electrons are involved).

<div class="Para-Indent"><span>The variability of oxidation states, a characteristic of transition elements, arises out of incomplete filling of </span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> orbitals in such a way that their oxidation states differ from each other by unity, e.g., V</span><span class="char-style-override-6">II</span><span>, V</span><span class="char-style-override-6">III</span><span>, V</span><span class="char-style-override-6">IV</span><span>, V</span><span class="char-style-override-6">V</span><span>.

For example, in group 6, Mo(VI) and W(VI) are found to be more stable than Cr(VI). Thus Cr(VI) in the form of dichromate in acidic medium is a strong oxidising agent, whereas MoO</span><span class="char-style-override-5">3</span><span> and WO</span><span class="char-style-override-5">3</span><span> are not.</span></div>

<div class="Text"><span>The transition metals and their compounds are known for their catalytic activity. This activity is ascribed to their ability to adopt multiple oxidation states and to form complexes. Vanadium(V) oxide (in Contact Process), finely divided iron (in Haber’s Process), and nickel (in Catalytic Hydrogenation) are some of the examples. Catalysts at a solid surface involve the formation of bonds between reactant molecules and atoms of the surface of the catalyst (first row transition metals utilise 3</span><span class="char-style-override-4">d</span><span> and 4</span><span class="char-style-override-4">s</span><span> electrons for bonding). This has the effect of increasing the concentration of the reactants at the catalyst surface and also weakening of the bonds in the reacting molecules (the activation energy is lowering). Also because the transition metal ions can change their oxidation states, they become more effective as catalysts. For example, iron(III) catalyses the reaction between iodide and persulphate ions.</span></div>

They have only one stable oxidation state and their chemistry provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of small changes in size and nuclear charge along a series of otherwise similar elements. The chemistry of the actinoids is, on the other hand, much more complicated. The complication arises partly owing to the occurrence of a wide range of oxidation states in these elements and partly because their radioactivity creates special problems in their study; the two series will be considered separately here.</span></div>

They react easily with water to give solutions giving +3 ions. The principal oxidation state is +3, although +4 and +2 oxidation states are also exhibited by some occasionally. The chemistry of the <span class="char-style-override-13">actinoids</span> is more complex in view of their ability to exist in different oxidation states. Furthermore, many of the actinoid elements are radioactive which make the study of these elements rather difficult. </div>
