The use of polymers in the manufacture of plastic buckets, cups and saucers, children’s toys, packaging bags, synthetic clothing materials, automobile tyres, gears and seals, electrical insulating materials and machine parts has completely revolutionised the daily life as well as the industrial scenario. Indeed, the polymers are the backbone of four major industries viz. plastics, elastomers, fibres and paints and varnishes.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-10">There are several ways of classification of polymers based on some special considerations. The following are some of the common classifications of polymers:</span></p>

        <h4 align="left" style="text-align: justify;" id="sigil_toc_id_3"><strong>15.1.1 Classification Based on Source</strong></h4>

        <p class="ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-10">Under this type of classification, there are three sub categories.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-13">1.</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">Natural polymers</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">These polymers are found in plants and animals. Examples are proteins, cellulose, starch, some resins and rubber.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-14">2. Semi-synthetic polymers</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">Cellulose derivatives as cellulose acetate (rayon) and cellulose nitrate, etc. are the usual examples of this sub category.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-14">3. Synthetic polymers</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">A variety of synthetic polymers as plastic (polythene), synthetic fibres (nylon 6,6) and synthetic rubbers (Buna - S) are examples of man-made polymers extensively used in daily life as well as in industry.</span></p>

        <h4 align="left" style="text-align: justify;" id="sigil_toc_id_4"><strong>15.1.2 Classification Based on Structure of Polymers</strong></h4>

        <p class="ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-10">There are three different types based on the structure of the polymers.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-14">1. Linear polymers</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">These polymers consist of long and straight chains. The examples are high density polythene, polyvinyl chloride, etc. These are represented as:</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">These are usually formed from bi-functional and tri-functional monomers and contain strong covalent bonds between various linear polymer chains, e.g. bakelite, melamine, etc. These polymers are depicted as follows:</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-10">Polymers can also be classified on the basis of mode of polymerisation into two sub groups.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-14">1. Addition polymers</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">The addition polymers are formed by the repeated addition of monomer molecules possessing double or triple bonds,</span> <span class="CharOverride-11">e.g.</span><span class="CharOverride-10">, the formation of polythene from ethene and polypropene from propene. However, the addition polymers formed by the polymerisation of a single monomeric species are known as</span> <span class="CharOverride-13">homopolymers</span><span class="CharOverride-10">,</span> <span class="CharOverride-11">e.g.</span><span class="CharOverride-10">, polythene.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">The condensation polymers are formed by repeated condensation reaction between two different bi-functional or tri-functional monomeric units. In these polymerisation reactions, the elimination of small molecules such as water, alcohol, hydrogen chloride, etc. take place. The examples are terylene (dacron), nylon 6, 6, nylon 6, etc. For example, nylon 6, 6 is formed by the condensation of hexamethylene diamine with adipic acid.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-10">A large number of polymer applications in different fields depend on their unique mechanical properties like tensile strength, elasticity, toughness, etc. These mechanical properties are governed by intermolecular forces,</span> <span class="CharOverride-11">e.g.</span><span class="CharOverride-10">, van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, present in the polymer. These forces also bind the polymer chains. Under this category, the polymers are classified into the following four sub groups on the basis of magnitude of intermolecular forces present in them.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-14">1.</span> <span class="CharOverride-14">Elastomers</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">These are rubber – like solids with elastic properties. In these elastomeric polymers, the polymer chains are held together by the weakest intermolecular forces. These weak binding forces permit the polymer to be stretched. A few ‘crosslinks’ are introduced in between the chains, which help the polymer to retract to its original position after the force is released as in vulcanised rubber. The examples are buna-S, buna-N, neoprene, etc.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">Fibres are the thread forming solids which possess high tensile strength and high modulus. These characteristics can be attributed to the strong intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding. These strong forces also lead to close packing of chains and thus impart crystalline nature. The examples are polyamides (nylon 6, 6), polyesters (terylene), etc.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">These are the linear or slightly branched long chain molecules capable of repeatedly softening on heating and hardening on cooling. These polymers possess intermolecular forces of attraction intermediate between elastomers and fibres. Some common thermoplastics are polythene, polystyrene, polyvinyls, etc.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-9"><span class="CharOverride-10">In this type of polymerisation, the molecules of the same monomer or diferent monomers add together on a large scale to form a polymer. The monomers used are unsaturated compounds,</span> <span class="CharOverride-11">e.g.</span><span class="CharOverride-10">, alkenes, alkadienes and their derivatives. This mode of polymerisation leading to an increase in chain length or chain growth can take place through the formation of either free radicals or ionic species. However, the free radical governed addition or chain growth polymerisation is the most common mode.</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-10"><span class="CharOverride-14">1. Free radical mechanism</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-11"><span class="CharOverride-10">A variety of alkenes or dienes and their derivatives are polymerised in the presence of a free radical generating initiator (catalyst) like benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxide, etc. For example, the polymerisation of ethene to polythene consists of heating or exposing to light a mixture of ethene with a small amount of benzoyl peroxide initiator. The process starts with the addition of phenyl free radical formed by the peroxide to the ethene double bond thus generating a new and larger free radical. This step is called</span> <span class="CharOverride-13">chain initiating step</span><span class="CharOverride-10">. As this radical reacts with another molecule of ethene, another bigger sized radical is formed. The repetition of this sequence with new and bigger radicals carries the reaction forward and the step is termed as</span> <span class="CharOverride-13">chain propagating step</span><span class="CharOverride-10">. Ultimately, at some stage the product radical thus formed reacts with another radical to form the polymerised product. This step is called the</span> <span class="CharOverride-13">chain terminating step</span><span class="CharOverride-10">. The sequence of steps may be depicted as follows:</span></p>

        <p class="ParaOverride-22"><span class="CharOverride-10">Low density polythene is chemically inert and tough but flexible and a poor conductor of electricity. Hence, it is used in the insulation of electricity carrying wires and manufacture of squeeze bottles, toys and flexible pipes.</span></p>

High density polythene (HDP) thus produced, consists of linear molecules and has a high density due to close packing. It is also chemically inert and more tough and hard. It is used for manufacturing buckets, dustbins, bottles, pipes, etc.</span></p>

This process consists of heating a mixture of raw rubber with sulphur and an appropriate additive at a temperature range between 373 K to 415 K.
