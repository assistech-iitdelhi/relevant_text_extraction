Someone had gone to their native village by a train, then a bus, and finally a bullock cart. One student had travelled by an aeroplane. Another spent many days of his holidays going on fishing trips in his uncle’s boat.</p>

			<p class="x1st-para">Long ago people did not have any means of transport. They used to move only on foot and carry goods on their back. Later on they began to use animals for transportation. </p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>For transport through water, routes, boats were used from ancient times. To begin with, boats were simple logs of wood in which a hollow cavity could be made. Later, people learnt to put together different pieces of wood and give shapes to the boats. These shapes</span> <span>imitated the shapes of the animals living in water. Recall our discussions of this streamlined shape of fish in Chapters 8 and 9.</span></p>
			<p class="Running-text">Invention of the wheel made a great change in modes of transport. The design of the wheel was improved over thousands of years.  Animals were used to pull carts that moved on wheels.</p>

			<p class="Running-text"><span>Until the beginning of the 19th century, people still depended on animals, boats and ships to transport them from place to place. The invention of steam engine led to the development of new means of transport. Railroads were made for steam engine driven carriages and wagons. Later came </span>automobiles such as motor cars, trucks and buses. Motorised boats and ships were used as means of transport on water. The early years of 1900 saw the development of aeroplanes. These were later improved to carry passengers and goods.  Electric trains, monorail, supersonic aeroplanes and spacecraft are some of the contributions of the 20th century.</p>

When you need to purchase something, is it possible for you to walk to the market? How will you know the answers to these questions? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">It is often important to know how far a place is, so that we can have an idea how we are going to reach that place — walk, take a bus or a train, a ship, an aeroplane or even a spacecraft!</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Sometimes, there are objects whose length or width we need to know. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">In Paheli and Boojho’s  classroom, there are large desks which are to be shared by two students. Paheli and Boojho share one desk, but, frequently end up objecting that the other is using a larger share of the desk.  </p>
			<p class="Running-text">On the teacher’s suggestion, they decided to measure the length of the desk, make a mark exactly in the middle of it and draw a line to separate the two halves of the desk. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Both Paheli and Boojho are very fond of playing <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="">gilli</span> <span class="">danda</span></span> with their friends.

<p class="Running-text">Hello! Now, when measured with the new set of <span class="">gilli</span> and <span class="">danda</span>, the desk length seems to be about two <span class="">danda</span> lengths, one <span class="">gilli</span> length with a small length still left out. This is less than one <span class="">gilli</span> length. Now what?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">What would you suggest Paheli and Boojho do, to measure the length of the whole desk? Can they use a cricket wicket and bails to measure the length or do you think that this might create the similar problem?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">One thing they could do is to take a small length of string and mark two points on it. This will be a string length. They can measure the width of the desk in string lengths (Fig. 10.4). How can they use the string to measure distances less than the length of a string? They can fold the string and mark it into1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 ‘string lengths’. Now, perhaps Paheli and Boojho can measure the exact length of the desk using the string.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">You would say that they should use the scale in their geometry box and solve their problem? Yes, Of course!</p>

			<p class="Running-text">&#160;Boojho has been reading about the way people used to measure distances before such standard scales were made and he has been trying to follow different methods of measuring distances.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">There are so many occasions when we come across a need to measure lengths and distances. The tailor needs to measure the length of the cloth to know if it is enough to stitch a <span class="">kurta</span>. A carpenter needs to measure the height and width of a cupboard to know how much wood he would need to make its door. The farmer needs to know the length and breadth or the area of his land to know how much seed he can sow and how much water would be needed for his crops. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Suppose, you are asked how tall you are? You want to tell the length of a straight line from the top of your head to the heel of your feet. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">How long is this room?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">How wide is this desk? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">How far is it from Delhi to Lucknow? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">How far away is the Moon from the Earth?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">All these questions have one thing in common. They all concern distance between two places.  The two places may be close enough, like the two ends of a table or they may be far apart, like Jammu and Kanyakumari. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Let us do a few measurements to see what exactly we need to do, when we measure distances or lengths.</p>

			<p class="Activity-Rule"><br/></p>
<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 1</h3>
			<p class="activity-text">Work in groups and each of you do this activity one by one. Using your foot as a unit of length, measure the length and breadth of the classroom. It is possible that while measuring these you may find some part remains to be measured as it is smaller than your foot. Use a string to measure the length of a part of your foot as you did before. Record your observations in Table 10.1.</p>
<p class="activity-text"><br/></p>
			<h5 class="Table-Heading sigil_not_in_toc" style="text-align: center;">Table 10.1 Measuring length and breadth of classroom</h5>

			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-2"><br/></div>
<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-2">
				Work in a group and each of you use your handspan as a unit to measure&#160;the width of a table or a desk in the classroom (Fig. 10.5).<img class="frame-14" src="../Images/10_05_hand%20span_fmt.jpeg" alt="10_05_hand%20span.tif" height="50%" width="50%"/>

			<p class="Running-text">Here too, you may find that you need string lengths equal to your handspan and then fractions of this string length to make the measurement. Record all observations in Table 10.2.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">We see that, measurement means the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity. This known fixed quantity is called a <span class="char-style-override-4" style="font-weight: bold;">unit</span>. The result of a measurement is expressed in two parts. One part is a number.  The other part is the unit of the measurement. For example, if in Activity 1, the length of the room is found to be 12 lengths of your foot, then 12 is the number and ‘foot length’ is the unit selected for the measurement. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Now, study all the measurements recorded in Table 10.1 and 10.2. Are all the measurements for the room using everybody’s foot, equal? Are everybody’s measurement, by handspan, of the width of the table equal? Perhaps the results could be different as the length of your handspan and that of your friends may not be the same. Similarly, the length of the foot may be slightly different for all the students. Therefore, when you tell your measurement using your handspan or length of foot  as a unit to others, they will not be able to understand how big the actual length is, unless they know the length of your handspan or foot. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">We see therefore, that some standard units of measurement are needed, that do not change from person to person.</p>
<p class="Running-text"><br/></p>
			<h2 class="Main-Head para-style-override-4" id="sigil_toc_id_5">10.4	Standard Units of Measurements </h2>
			<p class="x1st-para">In ancient times, the length of a foot, the width of a finger, and the distance of a step were commonly used as different units of measurements. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">The people of the Indus valley civilisation must have used very good measurements of length because we see evidence in excavations of perfectly geometrical constructions.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">A cubit as the length from the elbow to the finger tips was used in ancient Egypt and was also accepted as a unit of length in other parts of the world.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">People also used the “foot” as a unit of length in different parts of the world. The length of the foot used varied slightly from region to region. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">People measured a “yard” of cloth by the distance between the end of the outstretched arm and their chin. The Romans measured with their pace or steps. </p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>In ancient India, small length measurements used were an </span><span class="" style="font-style: italic;">angul</span><span> (finger) or a </span><span class="" style="font-style: italic;">mutthi</span><span> (fist). Even today, we can see flower sellers using their forearm as a unit of length for garlands in many towns of India. Many such body parts continue to be in use as unit of length, when convenient.</span></p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>However, everyone’s body parts could be of slightly different sizes. Th</span>is must have caused confusion in measurement. In 1790, the French created a standard unit of measurement called the metric system. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">For the sake of uniformity, scientists all over the world have accepted a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the International System of Units (SI units). The SI unit of length is a metre.  A metre scale is shown in Fig.10.6.  Also shown is the 15 cm scale in your geometry box.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">Each metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions, called centimetre (cm). Each centimetre has ten equal divisions, called millimetre (mm). Thus,</p>
			<p class="Running-text">1 m  = 100 cm</p>
			<p class="Running-text">1 cm = 10 mm   </p>
			<p class="Running-text">For measuring large distances, metre is not a convenient unit. We define a larger unit of length. It is called kilometre (km). </p>
			<p class="Running-text">1 km = 1000 m</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Now, we can repeat all our measurement activities using a standard scale and measure in SI units. Before we do that, we do need to know the correct way of measuring lengths and distances.</p>
<p class="Running-text"><br/></p>
			<h2 class="Main-Head para-style-override-2" id="sigil_toc_id_6">10.5 Correct Measurement of Length</h2>
			<p class="x1st-para">In our daily life we use various types of measuring devices. We  use a metre scale for measuring length. A tailor uses a tape, whereas a cloth merchant uses a metre rod. For measuring the length of an object, you must choose a suitable device. You cannot measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale, for instance. Measuring tape is more suitable for this. For small measurements, such as the length of your pencil, you can use a 15 cm scale from your geometry box.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">In taking measurement of a length, we need to take care of the following:</p>
			<p class="x1st-Tab para-style-override-5">1. 	Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in Fig.10.7.</p>
			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-2">
				<p class="activity-text"><img alt="10.2" src="../Images/10.2.png"/></p>
<p class="activity-text caption"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 10.7</span> Method of placing the scale along the length to be measured (a) correct and (b) incorrect</p>
</div>
			<p class="x1st-Tab para-style-override-5">2. 	In some scales, the ends may be broken. You may not be able to see the zero mark clearly (Fig.10.8 (a)]. In such cases, you should avoid taking measurements from the zero mark of the scale. You can use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm [Fig.10.8 (b)]. Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig.10.8 (b) the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end it is 14.3 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is (14.3-1.0) cm = 13.3 cm.</p>
			<p class="x1st-Tab para-style-override-5 caption"><img alt="10.3" src="../Images/10.3.png"/></p>

			<p class="x1st-Tab para-style-override-5">3. Correct position of the eye is also important for taking measurement. Your eye must be exactly in front of the point where the measurement is to be taken as shown in Fig.10.9. Position ‘B’   is the correct position of the eye. Note that from position ‘B’, the reading is 7.5 cm. From positions ‘A’ and ‘C’, the readings may be different.</p>

<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 3</h3>
			<p class="activity-text">Measure the height of your classmate using hand span and then by using a metre scale. For this, ask your classmate to stand with his back against a wall. Make a mark on the wall exactly above his head. Now, measure the distance from the floor to this mark on the wall with your handspan and then with a metre scale. Let all other students measure this length in a similar way. Record all observations in Table 10.3.</p>

</div>
			<p class="Running-text">Study carefully results obtained by different students. The results in column 2 may be different from each other as the length of the handspan may be different for different students. Look at the results in column 3 where the measurements are done using a standard scale. The results may be close to each other now, but, are they exactly equal? If not, why do you think there is a difference? After all, everybody is using the same scale and not different hand spans. This could be due to small errors in taking observations. In higher classes we will learn about the importance of knowing and handling such errors in measurement.</p>

<h2 class="Main-Head para-style-override-2" id="sigil_toc_id_7">10.6 Measuring the Length of a Curved Line</h2>
			<p class="x1st-para">We cannot measure the length of a curved line directly by using a metre scale. We can use a thread  to measure the length of a curved line.</p>
			<p class="Activity-Rule"><br/></p>
<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 4</h3>
			<p class="activity-text">Use a thread to measure the length of the curved line AB (Fig.10.10).  Put a knot on the thread near one of its ends. Place this knot on the point A. Now, place a small portion of the thread along the line, keeping it taut using your fingers and thumb. Hold the thread at this end point with one hand. Using the other hand, stretch a little more portion of the thread along the curved line. Go on repeating this process till the other end B of the curved line is reached. Make a mark on the thread where it touches the end B. Now stretch the thread along a metre scale. Measure the length between the knot in the beginning and the final mark on the thread. This gives the length of the curved line AB.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">In Activity 5, where did you place objects like a clock, a sewing machine or an electric fan in your grouping of objects? Are these objects moving from one place to other? No? Do you notice movement in any of their parts? The blades of the fan or the  hands of a clock— how are they moving? Is their movement similar to that of an ant or a train?  Let us now look at some types of motion to help us understand these differences.</p>

<h2 class="Main-Head" id="sigil_toc_id_9">10.8 Types of Motion</h2>
			<p class="x1st-para"><span>You may have observed the motion of a vehicle on a straight road, march-past </span><span>of soldiers in a parade or the falling of a stone (Fig. 10.12). What kind of motion is this? Sprinters in a <br/>100-</span><span>metre</span><span> race also move along a straight track. Can you think of more such examples from your surroundings?</span></p>
			<p class="Running-text"> In all these examples we see that the objects move along a straight line. This type of motion is called rectilinear motion.</p>

<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 7</h3>
			<p class="x1st-para">Take a stone, tie a thread to it and whirl it with your hand. Observe the motion of the stone. We see that the stone moves along a circular path. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">In this motion, the distance of the stone from your hand remains the same. This type of motion is called circular motion. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">The motion of a point marked on the blade of an electric fan or the hands of a clock are examples of circular motion (Fig. 10.13).   </p>

But, the blades of the fan rotate and so do the hands of a clock. If we mark a point anywhere on the blades of a fan or on the hands of a clock, the distance of this point from the centre of the fan or the clock, will remain the same as they rotate.</p>
			<p class="Running-text"><img alt="10.7" src="../Images/10.7.png"/></p>
<p class="Running-text">In some cases, an object repeats its motion after some time. This type of motion is called periodic motion. Take the stone tied with a string that you used in Activity 7. Now, hold the string in your hand and let the stone hang from it. This is a pendulum. Pull the stone to one side with the other hand and let it go. Now the pendulum is in motion. It is an example of periodic motion. A branch of a tree moving to and fro, motion of a child on a swing, strings of a guitar or the membrane of drums (<span class="">tabla</span>) being played, are all examples of periodic motion where an object or a part of it repeats its motion after a fixed interval of time (Fig. 10.14).</p>
<img alt="10.8" src="../Images/10.8.png"/><p class="Running-text caption"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 10.14</span>&#160;Examples of periodic motion<br/></p>
<p class="Running-text">Did you observe a sewing machine as a part of Activity 5? You must have observed that it remains at the same location while any point on its wheel moves with a circular motion. It also has a needle that moves up and down continuously, as long as the wheel rotates, isn’t it? This needle is  undergoing a periodic motion.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Have you observed closely, the motion of a ball along the ground? Here, the ball is  rolling on the ground – rotating as well as moving forward along the ground. Thus, the ball undergoes a rectilinear motion as well as rotational motion. Can you think of other examples where objects undergo combinations of different types of motion? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">We did many measurement activities and discussed some kinds of motion. We saw that motion is a change in the position of an object with time. The change in this position can <br/>be determined through distance measurements. This allows us to know how fast or slow a motion is. The movement of a snail on the ground, a butterfly flitting from flower to flower, a river flowing, an aeroplane flying, moon going around the Earth and blood flowing inside our bodies show that there is motion everywhere around us!</p>

<ul><li>Different modes of transport are used to go from one place to another.</li>
<li>In ancient times, people used length of a foot, the width of a finger, the distance of a step as units of measurement. This caused confusion and a need to develop a uniform system of measurement arose.</li>
<li>Now, we use International System of Units ( SI units). This is  accepted all over the world.</li>
<li>Metre is the unit of length in SI unit.<span class="char-style-override-6"></span></li>
<li>Motion in a straight line is called rectilinear motion.</li>
<li>In circular motion an object moves such that its distance from a fixed point remains the same.</li>
<li>Motion that repeats itself after some period of time is called periodic motion.</li>
