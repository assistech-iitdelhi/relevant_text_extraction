<h2 class="Main-Head" id="sigil_toc_id_5">2.1	What Do Different Food Items Contain?</h2>
			<p class="_st-para">We know that each dish is usually made up of one or more ingredients, which we get from plants or animals. These ingredients contain some components that are needed by our body. These components are called <span class="CharOverride-2">nutrients</span>. The major nutrients in our food are named carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. In addition, food contains dietary fibres and water which are also needed by our body.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Do all foods contain all these nutrients? With some simple methods we can test whether cooked food or a raw ingredient contains one or more of these nutrients. The tests for presence of carbohydrates, proteins and fats are simpler to do as compared to the tests for other nutrients. Let us do these tests and record all our observations in Table 2.2.</p>
<p class="Running-text">For carrying out these tests, you will need solutions of iodine, copper sulphate and caustic soda. You will also need a few test tubes and a dropper.<br/></p>
<p class="Running-text">Try these tests on cooked food items as well as raw materials. Table 2.2 shows you a way to record the observations from these tests. Some food items are given in this table. You can conduct the tests either with these or any other available food items. Do these tests carefully and do not try to eat or taste any chemicals.</p>
<p class="Running-text">If the required solutions are not available in readymade form, your teacher can prepare them as given in the box.</p>
<p class="Running-text"><img alt="Table2_0" src="../Images/Table2_0.png" height="50%" width="50%"/></p>
<p class="Running-text">Let us begin by testing different food items to see if they contain&#160;<span class="CharOverride-2">carbohydrates</span>. There are many types of carbohydrates. The main carbohydrates found in our food are in the form of starch and sugars. We can easily test if a food item contains starch.</p>

<h4 class="sub-head sigil_not_in_toc" id="sigil_toc_id_9">Test for Protein</h4>
<p class="_st-para">Take a small quantity of a food item for testing. If the food you want to test is a solid, you first need to make a paste of it or powder it. Grind or mash a small quantity of the food item. Put some of this in a clean test tube, add 10 drops of water to it and shake the&#160;test tube.</p>

A violet colour indicates presence of&#160;<span class="CharOverride-2">proteins</span>&#160;in the food item.<span class="CharOverride-2"></span></p>

Does it have an oily patch? Hold the paper against light. Are you able to see the light faintly, through this patch?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">An oily patch on paper shows that the food item contains <span class="CharOverride-2">fat</span>. The food items may sometimes contain a little water. Therefore, after you have rubbed an item on paper, let the paper dry for a while. If there were any water that may have come from food, it would dry up after some time. If no oily patch shows up after this, the food item does not contain any fat. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">What do these tests show? Are fats, proteins and starch present in all the food items that you tested? Does a food item contain more than one nutrient? Do you find any food item that does not contain any of these nutrients? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">We tested food items for three nutrients — carbohydrates, proteins and fats. There are also other nutrients like <span class="CharOverride-2">vitamins </span>and <span class="CharOverride-2">minerals</span> that are present in different food items.

There is also a group of vitamins called Vitamin B-complex. Our body needs all types of vitamins in small quantities. Vitamin A keeps our skin and eyes healthy. Vitamin C helps body to fight against many diseases. Vitamin D helps our body to use calcium for bones and teeth. Foods that are rich in different vitamins are shown in Fig. 2.6 to Fig. 2.9.</p>

<p class="activity-text ParaOverride-6">Most food items, usually, have more than one nutrient. You may have noticed this, while recording your observations in Table 2.2. However, in a given raw material, one particular nutrient may be present in much larger quantity than in others. For example, rice has more carbohydrates than other nutrients. Thus, we say that rice is a “carbohydrate rich” source of food.</p>
<p class="activity-text ParaOverride-6">Besides these nutrients, our body needs&#160;<span class="CharOverride-2">dietary fibres</span>&#160;and water. Dietary fibres are also known as roughage. Roughage is mainly provided by plant products in our foods. Whole grains and pulses, potatoes, fresh fruits and vegetables are main sources of roughage. Roughage does not provide any nutrient to our body, but is an essential component of our food and adds to its bulk. This helps our body get rid of undigested food.</p>
