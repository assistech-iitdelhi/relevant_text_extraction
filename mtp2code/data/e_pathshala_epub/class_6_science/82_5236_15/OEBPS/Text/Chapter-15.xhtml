<p class="_st-para">We have learnt in Chapter 9 that all living things require air. But, have you ever seen air? You might not have seen air, but, surely you must have felt its presence in so many ways. You notice it when the leaves of the trees rustle or the clothes hanging on a clothes-line sway. Pages of an open book begin fluttering when the fan is switched on. The moving air makes it possible for you to fly your kite. Do you remember Activity 3 in Chapter 5 in which you separated the sand and sawdust by winnowing? Winnowing is more effective in moving air. You may have noticed that during storms the wind blows at a very high speed. It may even uproot trees and blow off the rooftops.</p>

Now tilt the bottle slightly. Does the water now enter the bottle? Do you see bubbles coming out of the bottle or hear any bubbly sound? Can you now guess what was in the bottle? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Yes! You are right. It is “air”, that was present in the bottle. The bottle was not empty at all. In fact, it was filled completely with air even when you turned it upside down. That is why you notice that water does not enter the bottle when it is pushed in an inverted position, as there was no space for air to escape. When the bottle was tilted, the air was able to come out in the form of bubbles, and water filled up the empty space that the air has occupied. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">This activity shows that air occupies space. It fills all the space in the bottle. It is present everywhere around us. Air has no colour and one can see through it. It is transparent. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Our earth is surrounded by a thin layer of air. This layer extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the earth and is called atmosphere. As we move higher in the atmosphere, the air gets rarer.</p>

<h2 class="Main-Head" id="sigil_toc_id_3">15.2 What is Air Made up of?</h2>
			<p class="_st-para">Until the eighteenth century, people thought that air was just one substance. Experiments have proved that it is really not so. Air is a mixture of many gases. What kind of a mixture is it? Let us find out about some of the major components of this mixture, one by one. </p>
<p class="_st-para"><br/></p>
			<h3 class="sub-head sigil_not_in_toc">Water vapour </h3>
			<p class="_st-para">We have learnt earlier that air contains water vapour. We also saw that, when air comes in contact with a cool surface, it condenses and drops of water appear on the cooled surfaces. The presence of water vapour in air is important for the water cycle in nature. </p>
<p class="_st-para"><br/></p>
			<h3 class="sub-head sigil_not_in_toc">Oxygen</h3>
			<p class="Activity-Rule"><br/></p>
<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 3</h3>
			<p class="activity-text">In the presence of your teacher, fix two small candles of the same length on a table. Light both the candles. Cover one of the candles with an inverted glass tumbler. Observe both the candles carefully.</p>
<div class="_idGenObjectLayout-1"><div id="_idContainer030"><div id="_idContainer023" class="Basic-Graphics-Frame _idGenObjectStyleOverride-2">
<img alt="15.1" src="../Images/15.1.png" height="50%" width="50%"/><p class="caption ParaOverride-4"><span class="CharOverride-3" style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 15.6</span><span> Air has oxygen</span><br/></p>
</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="Running-text">Do both the candles continue to burn or go off?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">You must have observed that the candle covered with glass tumbler got extinguished after some time, whereas the other candle continued burning.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">What can be the reason for this? Think about it.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">It seems that the candle got extinguished because the component inside of the glass tumbler, which supports burning, is limited. Most of the component is used up by the burning candles. However, the other candle is getting continued supply of air. This component of air, which supports burning, is known as oxygen.</p>
<p class="Running-text"><br/></p>
			<h3 class="sub-head sigil_not_in_toc">Nitrogen</h3>
			<p class="_st-para">In Activity 3 did you observe that air is still present in the glass bottle even after the candle blew out? This indicates the presence of some component in the air, which does not support burning. The major part of air (which does not support burning candle) is <span class="CharOverride-5" style="font-weight: bold;">nitrogen</span>.</p>
			<p class="sub-head ParaOverride-6"><br/></p>
<h3 class="sub-head ParaOverride-6 sigil_not_in_toc">Carbon dioxide</h3>
			<p class="_st-para">In a closed room, if there is some material that is burning, you may <br/>have felt suffocation. This is due to excess of carbon dioxide that may be accumulating in the room, as the burning continues. Carbon dioxide makes up a small component of the air around us. Plants and animals consume oxygen for respiration and produce carbon dioxide. Plant and animal matter also consumes oxygen on burning and produces mainly carbon dioxide and a few other gases. It is advisable not to burn dry leaves and discarded remains of the crop, which pollute our surroundings.</p>
			<p class="sub-head ParaOverride-7"><br/></p>
<h3 class="sub-head ParaOverride-7 sigil_not_in_toc">Dust and smoke</h3>
			<p class="_st-para">The burning of fuel also produces smoke. Smoke contains a few gases and fine dust particles and is often harmful. That is why you see long chimneys in factories. This takes the harmful smoke and gases away from our noses, but, brings it closer to the birds flying up in the sky! </p>
			<p class="_st-para ParaOverride-8">Dust particles are always present in air. </p>
			<p class="Activity-Rule"><br/></p>
<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 4</h3>
			<p class="activity-text">Find a sunny room in your school/home. Close all the doors and windows with curtains pulled down to make the room dark. Now, open the door or a window facing the sun, just a little, in such a way that it allows sunlight to enter the room only through a slit. Look carefully at the incoming beam&#160;of sunlight.<br/></p>

			<p class="Running-text">During winters you might have observed similar beam of sunlight filter through the trees in which dust particles appear to dance merrily around!</p>
			<p class="Running-text">This shows that air also contains dust particles. The presence of dust particles in air varies from time to time, and from place to place. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">We inhale air when we breathe through our nostrils. Fine hair and mucus are present inside the nose to prevent dust particles from getting into the respiratory system.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">Do you recall being scolded by your parents when you breathe through your mouth? If you do that, harmful dust particles may enter your body.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">We may conclude, then, that air contains some gases, water vapour and dust particles. The gases in air are mainly nitrogen, oxygen, small amount of carbon dioxide, and many other gases. However, there may be some variations in the composition of air from place to place. We see that air contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen. In fact, these two gases together make up 99% of the air. The remaining 1% is constituted by carbon dioxide and a few other gases and water vapour (Fig. 15.9). </p>

			<p class="Running-text">When the water is poured on the lump of soil, it displaces the air which is seen in the form of bubbles. The organisms that live inside the soil and the plant roots respire in this air. A lot of burrows and holes are formed in deep soil by the animals living in the soil. These burrows also make spaces available for air to move in and out of the soil. However, when it rains heavily, water fills up all the spaces occupied by the air in the soil. In this situation, animals living in the soil have to come out for respiration. Could this be the reason why earthworms come out of the soil, only during heavy rains?</p>
<p class="Running-text">Have you ever wondered why all the oxygen of atmosphere does not get used up though a large number of organisms are consuming it? Who is refilling the oxygen in the atmosphere? </p>

<h2 class="Main-Head ParaOverride-13" id="sigil_toc_id_5">15.4 	How is the Oxygen in the Atmosphere Replaced?</h2>
			<p class="_st-para">In Chapter 7, we read about photosynthesis. In this process, plants make their own food and oxygen is produced along with it. Plants also consume oxygen for respiration, but they produce more of it than they consume. That is why we say plants produce oxygen. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">It is obvious that animals cannot live without plants. The balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is maintained through respiration in plants and animals and by the photosynthesis in plants. This shows  the interdependence of plants and animals. </p>

			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab">2. 	Observe the leaves of trees, shrubs or bushes planted by the roadside. Note whether their leaves have some dust or soot deposited over them. Take similar observations with the leaves of trees in the school compound or in a garden. Is there any difference in deposition of soot on leaves of trees near the roadside? What could be the possible reasons for this difference? Take a map of your city or town and try to identify regions in the map where you have noticed very thick layer of soot on the plants by the roadside. Compare with results obtained by other classmates and mark these areas on the map. Perhaps the results from all the students could be summarised and reported in newspapers.</p>
