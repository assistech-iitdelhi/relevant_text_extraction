			<p class="Running-text"><span>Do this activity during day time on a sunny day. Use a healthy, well watered plant that has been growing in the sun</span>. Enclose a leafy branch of the  plant in a polythene cover and tie up its mouth as shown in Fig. 7.11. Tie up the mouth of another empty polythene cover and keep it also in the sun.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">After a few hours, observe the inner surface of the covers. What do you see? Are there any droplets of water? How do you think they got there? [Don’t forget to remove the polythene bag after the activity!]</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Water comes out of leaves in the form of vapour by a process called <span class="CharOverride-2">transpiration</span>. Plants release a lot of water into the air through this process. We will learn more about this in Chapter 14.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Why did we tie a cover around the leaves? Would we have seen the water evaporate if we had not tied a polythene cover? What makes the water appear on the polythene bag? In Chapter 5, we noticed water changing into different forms in some of our activities. Can you think of these and name the process that makes water drops appear on the polythene cover?</p>

			<p class="Running-text">What do you observe? Compare your observations with those done  in Chapter 2, when you tested food for presence of different nutrients. Does this mean that the leaf has starch in it?  </p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>In Chapter 2, we saw that a slice of raw potato also shows the presence of starch. Potatoes get this starch from their leaves and store it. Leaves prepare their food in the presence of sunlight and a green coloured substance present in them. For this, they also use water and carbon dioxide. This process is called </span><span class="CharOverride-2">photosynthesis</span><span>. Oxygen is given out in this process. The food prepared by leaves ultimately gets stored in different parts of plant. </span></p>
			<p class="Running-text">We have seen that the stem supplies leaf with water. The leaf uses the water to make food. The leaves also lose water through transpiration. How do the stem and leaves get water? That is where the roots come in!</p>

<p class="Running-text">Where do you think the petals are in a closed bud? Which is the most prominent part in a bud? Did you see that this part is made of small leaf-like structures? They are called <span class="CharOverride-2">sepals</span>. Take a flower and observe its petals and sepals. Now, answer the following questions:</p>

<p class="Running-text">To see the inner parts of the flower clearly, you have to cut it open, if its petals are joined. For example, in <span class="char-style-override-9">datura </span>and other bell-shaped flowers, the petals have to be cut lengthwise and spread out so that the inner parts can be seen clearly (Fig. 7.21).</p>

<p class="Running-text">Try to find out the names of as many flowers as you can by asking the gardener or any other person. Remember, not to pluck more flowers than you need. Based on what you have filled in Table 7.3, answer the following questions.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Do all flowers have sepals, petals, stamens and pistils? Are there flowers that do not have one or more of these? Are there flowers which have parts other than these? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Did you find any flower which has no difference between sepals and petals? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Did you find any flower in which the number of stamens is different from the number of petals? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Do you now agree that the structure of the flower is not always the same? The number of sepals, petals, stamens and pistils may also be different in different flowers. Some of these parts may even be absent at times! </p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>We have studied some features and functions of leaves, stems and roots. We studied the structure of different flowers. We will learn about the function of flowers in higher classes. We will also learn about fruits in higher classes. </span></p>

<div class="lining_box3">
<p class="Exercise para-style-override-25"></p>
<ul><li>Plants are usually grouped into herbs, shrubs and trees based on their height, nature of stem and branches.</li>
<li>The stem bears leaves, flowers and fruits.</li>
<li>Leaf usually has a petiole and lamina.</li>
<li>The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation. It can be reticulate or parallel.</li>
<li>Leaves give out water vapour through the process of transpiration.</li>
<li>Green leaves make their food by the process of photosynthesis using carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight.</li>
<li>Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil. They also anchor the plant firmly in the soil.</li>
<li>Roots are mainly of two types: tap root and fibrous root.</li>
<li>Plants having leaves with reticulate venation have tap roots while plants having leaves with parallel venation have fibrous roots.</li>
<li>The stem conducts water from roots to the leaves (and other parts) and food from leaves to other parts of the plant.</li>
<li>The parts of a flower are sepals, petals, stamens and pistil.</li>

				<p class="Exercise-1st-tab">	Do this activity with a number of leaves over a period of few weeks. For every leaf that you wish to study, pluck it and wrap it in a wet cloth and take it home. Now, place the leaf between the folds of a newspaper and place a heavy book on it. You can also put it under your mattress or a trunk! Take out the leaf after a week. Paste it on a paper and write a poem or story about it. With your leaf collection pasted in a book, you can become an expert about leaves!</p>
