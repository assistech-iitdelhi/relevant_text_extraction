They were very excited and decided to use the prize money to buy clothes for their parents. When they saw a large variety of cloth material, they got confused (Fig. 3.1). The shopkeeper explained that some clothes or fabrics were cotton and some were synthetic. He also had woollen mufflers and shawls. There were many silk sarees as well. Paheli and Boojho felt very excited. They touched and felt these different fabrics. Finally, they bought a woollen muffler and a cotton saree.</span></p>

			<p class="activity-text">&#160;You might have observed something similar when you try to thread a needle. Many a time, the end of the thread is separated into a few thin strands.

Can you name some states of our country where cotton is grown? The fruits of the cotton plant (<span class="char-style-override-2">cotton bolls</span>) are about the size of a lemon. After maturing, the bolls burst open and the seeds covered with cotton fibres can be seen. Have you ever seen a cotton field that is ready for picking?

			<p class="">Have you ever wondered what materials people used in ancient times for clothes?  It appears that in those times people used the bark and big leaves of trees or animal skins and furs to cover themselves. </p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>After people began to settle in agricultural communities, they learnt to weave twigs and grass into mats and baskets. Vines, animal fleece or hair were twisted together into long strands. These were woven into fabrics. The early Indians wore fabrics made out of cotton that grew in the regions near the river Ganga. Flax is also a plant that gives natural fibres. In ancient Egypt, cotton as well as flax were cultivated near the river Nile and were used for making fabrics.</span><span> </span></p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>In those days, stitching was not known. People simply draped the fabrics around different parts of their body. Many different ways of draping fabrics were used. With the invention of the sewing needle, people started stitching fabrics to make clothes. Stitched clothes have gone through many variations since this invention. But, is it not amazing that even today </span><span class="char-style-override-4">saree</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-4">dhoti</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-4">lungi</span><span> or turban is used as an un-stitched piece of fabric?</span></p>
