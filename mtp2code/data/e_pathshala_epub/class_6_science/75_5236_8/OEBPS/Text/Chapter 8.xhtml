Different parts of your body move while you remain at the same place, in these examples. You also move from one place to another — you get up and go to your teacher or to the school compound, or go home after school. You walk, run, skip, jump and move from place to place.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">Press your fingers against the top of your head, face, neck, nose, ear, back of the shoulder, hands and legs including the fingers and toes.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Do you get a feel of something hard pressing against your fingers?  The hard structures are the bones. Repeat this activity on other parts of your body. So many bones!</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Bones cannot be bent. So, how do we bend our elbow? It is not one long bone from the upper arm to our wrist. It is different bones joined together at the elbow. Similarly, there are many bones present in each part of the body.  We can bend or move our body only at those points where bones meet.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">There are different types of joints in our body to help us carry out different movements and activities. Let us learn about some of them.</p>

			<p class="activity-text">Let us look at the kind of movement allowed by a hinge. Make a cylinder with cardboard or thick chart paper, as shown in Fig. 8.5. Attach a small pencil to the cylinder by piercing the cylinder at the centre, as shown. Make a hollow half cylinder from cardboard such that the rolled up cylinder can fit inside it easily. The hollow half cylinder with the rolled up cylinder sitting inside it, allows movement like a hinge. Try to move the rolled up cylinder. How does it move? How is this movement different from what we saw with our constructed ball and socket joint? We saw this kind of movement at the elbow in Activity 1. What we have constructed in Fig. 8.5 is different from a hinge, of course. But, it illustrates the direction in which a hinge allows movement. The elbow has a hinge joint that allows only a back and forth movement (Fig. 8.6). Can you think of more examples of such joints?</p>

Such joints are called <span class="CharOverride-2">fixed</span> joints. When you open your mouth wide, you can move your lower jaw away from your head, isn’t it? Try to move your upper jaw, now. Are you able to move it? There is a  joint between the upper jaw and the rest of the head which is a fixed joint. </p>

<p class="Running-text">How do we know that this is the shape of a human skeleton? How do we know the shapes of the different bones in our body? We can have some idea about the shape and number of bones in some parts of our body by feeling them. One way we could know this shape better would be to look at X-ray images of the human body.</p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>Did you or anyone in your family ever have an X-ray of any part of your body taken? Sometimes when we are hurt, or have an accident, doctors use these X-ray images to find out about any possible injuries that might </span>have happened to the bones. The X-rays show the shapes of the bones in our bodies.</p>
			<p class="Running-text"> Feel the bones in your forearm, upper arm, lower leg and upper leg. Try to find the number of bones in each part. Similarly, feel the bones of your ankle and knee joints and compare these with the X-ray images (Fig. 8.8).</p>

To move the bone in the opposite direction, the relaxed musle contracts to pull the bone towards its original position, while the first relaxes. A muscle can only pull. It cannot push. Thus, two muscles have to work together to move a bone. (Fig. 8.17)</p>

			<p class="Running-text">The body of an earthworm is made up of many rings joined end to end. An earthworm does not have bones. It has muscles which help to extend and shorten the body.  During movement, the earthworm first extends the front part of the body, keeping the rear portion fixed to the ground. Then it fixes the front end and releases the rear end. It then shortens the body and pulls the rear end forward. This makes it move forward by a small distance. Repeating such muscle expansions and contractions, the earthworm can move through soil. Its body secretes a slimy substance to help the movement. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">How does it fix parts of its body to the ground? Under its body, it has a large number of tiny bristles (hair like structures) projecting out. The bristles are connected with muscles. The bristles help to get a good grip on the ground. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">The earthworm, actually, eats its way through the soil! Its body then throws away the undigested part of the material that it eats. This activity of an earthworm makes the soil more useful for plants. </p>

			<p class="x1st-para">Birds fly in the air and walk on the ground. Some birds like ducks and swans also swim in water. The birds can fly because their bodies are well suited for flying. Their bones are hollow and light. The bones of the hind limbs are typical for walking and perching. The bony parts of the forelimbs are modified as wings. The shoulder bones are strong. The breastbones are modified to hold muscles of flight which are used to move the wings up and down (Fig. 8.21).</p>

<p class="Running-text">The shape is such that water can flow around it easily and allow the fish to move in water.	The skeleton of the fish is covered with strong muscles. During swimming, muscles make the front part of the body curve to one side and the tail part swings towards the opposite side. The fish forms a curve as shown in Fig. 8.24. Then, quickly, the body and tail curve to the other side. This makes a jerk and pushes the body forward. A series of such jerks make the fish swim ahead. This is helped by the fins of the tail.</p>

<p class="char-style-override-3 caption"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 8.25</span>&#160;Movement in a snake</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Snakes have a long backbone. They have many thin muscles. They are connected to each other even though they are far from one another. Muscles also interconnect the backbone, ribs and skin.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">The snake’s body curves into many loops. Each loop of the snake gives it a forward push by pressing against the ground. Since its long body makes many loops and each loop gives it this push, the snake moves forward very fast and not in a straightline.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">We have learned about the use of bones and muscles for the movements of different animals. Paheli and Boojho have many questions in their sacks about the different movements in animals. So must you be having many unanswered questions buzzing in your minds? The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his book <span class="char-style-override-5">Gait of Animals</span>, asked himself these questions. Why do different animals have the body parts that they do have and how do these body parts help animals to move the way they do? What are the similarities and differences in these body parts between different animals? How many body parts are needed by different animals for moving from place to place? Why two legs for humans and four for cows and buffaloes? Many animals seem to be having an even number of legs, why? Why is the bending of our legs different from that of our arms? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">So many questions and perhaps we have looked for some answers through our activities in this chapter and we need to look for many more answers. </p>

				<p class="Running-text para-style-override-3">Yoga is an invaluable gift of the ancient Indian tradition. The United Nations declared 21 June as International Day of Yoga. Yoga keeps a person healthy. It helps in keeping the backbone erect, enabling you to sit straight and not slouch. Many postures in yoga require you to lift your own weight, which help in making the bones strong and help ward off osteoporosis. It also helps in relieving joint pain, which is mostly observed in elderly people. It tunes all muscles in the body and keeps them active. It keeps the heart healthy and makes it work more efficiently. Certain yoga postures should be performed under the supervision of a trained person.</p>

				<p class="Exercise-running-text para-style-override-15">We discussed the many movements our bodies are capable of. Healthy bones, muscles, joints and cartilages are needed by the body for all these movements. Some of us suffer from conditions that could make these movements not so easy. In a whole class activity, try to find ways that one would manage everyday activities, if any one of our body movements was not possible. In Activity 1, for instance, you tied a scale on your arm and disabled the elbow movement. Think of other ways of restricting normal body movements and find ways that everyday activities could then be managed.</p>
