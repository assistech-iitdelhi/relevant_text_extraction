<p class="ParaOverride-7">The water in the oceans and seas has many salts dissolved in it — the water is saline. So, it is not fit for drinking and other domestic, agricultural and industrial needs.

Many of us live in places far away from the oceans. Does the water supply in these places also depend on the oceans?

<p class="Activity-Rule">Do you remember Activity 6 in Chapter 5 in which water with salt dissolved in it was heated? What did we find? The water evaporated and the salt was left behind. This activity gives us an idea that, on heating, water changes into its vapour. We also realise from this activity, that water vapour does not carry away the salt with it. Water vapours so formed become a part of the air and cannot usually be seen. We also found that heating is essential to convert water into its vapour. However, we have seen that water changes into its vapour also from the fields, roads, rooftops and&#160;other land areas. We also discussed in&#160;Chapter 5 that to obtain salt, water from the sea is left in shallow pits to let the water evaporate. From where does this water get the heat it needs to evaporate? Let us find out.<br/></p>
<p class="Activity-Rule"><br/></p>
<h3 class="Activity-Rule sigil_not_in_toc">Activity 2</h3>
			<p class="activity-text">Take two similar plates. Place one of the plates in sunlight and keep the other under shade. Now, pour equal amount of water in each of the plates (Fig. 14.5). You can use a cap of a bottle to measure water. Make sure that water does not spill over. Observe the two plates after every 15 minutes. Does the water seem to disappear? From which plate does it disappear first? What is the source of heat for this evaporation?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">During the daytime, sunlight falls on the water in oceans, rivers, lakes and ponds. The fields and other land areas also receive sunlight. As a result, water from all these places continuously changes into vapour. However, the salts dissolved in the water are left behind.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">In Activity 2, did you find that water also disappeared from the plate kept in the shade, though it could have taken more time? Does the heat from the sunlight reach here? Yes, during the daytime all the air surrounding us gets heated. This warm air provides heat for evaporation of water in the shade. Thus, evaporation takes place from all open surfaces of water. As a result, water vapour gets continuously added to air. However, evaporation of water is a slow process. That is why we rarely notice its loss from a bucket full of water. In sunlight, evaporation takes place faster. On heating water on a burner, its evaporation takes place even faster. Is there any other process through which water vapour gets transferred into air?</p>

Remaining part of this water is released by the plants into air, as water vapour through the process of transpiration.

How does it happen? As we go higher from the surface of the earth, it gets cooler. When the air moves up, it gets cooler and cooler. At sufficient heights, the air becomes so cool that the water vapour present in it condenses to form tiny drops of water called droplets.

<p class="_st-para">What happens to the water that rain and snow bring to different regions of earth? Almost all land surfaces are above the level of oceans. Most of the water that falls on the land as rain and snow sooner or later goes back to the oceans. This happens in many ways.</p>
<p class="_st-para">Snow in the mountains melts into water. This water flows down the mountains in the form of streams and rivers (Fig. 14.8). Some of the water that falls on land as rain, also flows in the form of rivers and streams. Most of the rivers cover long distances on land and ultimately fall into a sea or an ocean. However, water of some rivers flows into lakes.</p>

<p class="Running-text">The rainwater also fills up the lakes and ponds. A part of the rainwater gets absorbed by the ground and seems to disappear in the soil. Some of this water is brought back to the air by the process of evaporation and transpiration. The rest seeps into the ground. Most of this water becomes available to us as&#160;<span class="CharOverride-6">ground water</span>. Open wells are fed by ground water. Ground water is the source for many lakes as well. It is also this ground water which is drawn by a handpump or a tubewell. The more handpumps or tubewells that are used in an area, the deeper we need to dig to find this ground water. The loss in the level of ground water due to over use, is worrisome.</p>
<p class="Running-text">Paheli wants to share a concern with you.  In those areas where the land has little or no vegetation, the rainwater flows away quickly. Flowing rainwater also takes the top layer of the soil away with it. There are few areas where most of the land is covered with concrete. This reduces the seepage of rainwater into the ground which ultimately affects the availability of ground water. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">We now know that water brought back to the surface of the earth by rain, hail or snow, goes back to oceans. Thus, water from the ocean and surface of the earth goes into air as vapour; returns as rain, hail or snow and finally goes back to the oceans. The circulation of water in this manner is known as the <span class="CharOverride-6">water cycle </span>(Fig.14.9).  This circulation of water between ocean and land is a continuous process. This maintains the supply of water on land. </p>

In some parts of the world it rains throughout the year while there are places where it rains only for a few days. In our country, most of the rainfall occurs during the monsoon season. Rains bring relief especially after hot summer days. The sowing of many crops depends on the arrival of monsoon.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">However, excess of rainfall may lead to many problems (Fig. 14.10). Heavy rains may lead to rise in the level of water in rivers, lakes and ponds.  The water may then spread over large areas causing floods. The crop fields, forests, villages, and cities may get submerged by water (Fig. 14.11).

			<p class="_st-para">Only a small fraction of water available on the Earth is fit for use of plants, animals and humans. Most of the water is in the oceans and it cannot be used directly. When the level of the ground water decreases drastically, this can not be used any more. The total amount of water on Earth remains the same, but, the water available for use is very limited and is decreasing with over usage.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">The demand for water is increasing day-by-day. The number of people using water is increasing with rising population. In many cities, long queues for collection of water are a common site (Fig. 14.12). Also, more and more water is being used for producing food and by the industries. These factors are leading to shortage of water in many parts of the world. Hence, it is very important that water is used carefully. We should take care not to waste water.</p>
