			<p class="Running-text">We do not have magical powers, of course. But, we can still change a few things around us, perhaps many things. Can you list a few things you can change around you, with no magic involved? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Many changes are taking place around us on their own. In the fields, the crops change from time to time. Sometimes, leaves fall from trees, change colour and dry out. The flowers bloom and then wither away. Are any changes happening in your body? Your nails grow, your hair grows, you grow taller and your weight increases as you grow. Did you realise earlier that so many changes are taking place around you all the time? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Can some of the changes be grouped together? </p>
			<p class="Running-text">How can we group various changes? It might help, if we find some similarities between them. </p>

			<p class="x1st-para">We all have seen the tools which are used to dig the soil (Fig. 6.6 ). Have you ever seen how the iron blade in these tools is fixed to the wooden handle?</p>
<p class="Running-text">The iron blade of these tools has a ring in which the wooden handle is fixed. Normally, the ring is slightly smaller in size than the wooden handle. To fix the handle, the ring is heated and it becomes slightly larger in size <span class="char-style-override-5">(expands)</span>. Now, the handle easily fits into the ring. When the ring cools down it contracts and fits tightly on to <br/>the handle.</p>

</div>
<p class="Running-text">Such a change is also used for fixing the metal rim on a wooden wheel of a cart as shown in Fig.6.7. Again the metal rim is made slightly smaller than the wooden wheel. On heating, the rim expands and fits onto the wheel. Cold water is then poured over the rim, which contracts and fits tightly onto the wheel.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">When we heat water in a pan, it begins to boil after some time. If we continue to heat further, the quantity of water in the pan begins to decrease. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">The water changes into its vapour. In Activity 7, Chapter 5 you have observed that water vapour gets changed into liquid water when it is cooled. We all have noticed melting of ice. Ice melts when it is heated. What does it change into? Is it possible to change this water back into ice?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Let us observe some more changes.</p>

			<p class="Running-text">Repeat Activity 7 with an incense stick. Wait till it burns away completely. What are the changes that occur in the incense stick? The stick burns to produce some new material. These are ash and some gases. We cannot see these gases but can sense them due to their pleasant smell. Can this change be reversed? And what about the change,&#160;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.333;">which occurred in the matchstick you used for lighting the candle or incense stick?</span></p>

What about the changes&#160;that occur when two substances are mixed together?</p>
<p class="Running-text" style="margin: 10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px;">In Chapter 4, we dissolved salt in water. Do you think a change occured in salt or in water? Is it possible to reverse this change? Wait, in Chapter 5, we learnt how to separate salt from its solution in water. So, can we say that the change due to dissolving salt in water be reversed?</p>
<p class="Exercise-1st-tab" style="margin: 10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px;">Paheli asks if you have ever seen curd being set. A small quantity of curd is added to warm milk. The milk is stirred and is set aside for a few hours at a warm place. In a few hours, the milk changes into curd. Can this change be reversed?</p>
<p class="Exercise-1st-tab" style="margin: 10px 0px 0px; padding: 0px;">We find that a few ways to bring about a change in a substance could be, by heating it or by mixing it with some other substance. We also find that some changes can be reversed, while some others cannot be reversed. There must be many other ways of changing things around us. It is possible that some of them could be reversed. Thus, changes around us could be grouped as those that can be reversed or cannot be reversed. In higher classes, you will learn more about the ways in which changes can be made and the way these can be grouped.</p>
