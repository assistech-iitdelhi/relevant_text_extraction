<h1 class="unit-text para-style-override-1" id="sigil_toc_id_1">GENETICS AND EVOLUTION</h1>
			<p class="unit-text para-style-override-1">The work of Mendel and others who followed him gave us an idea of inheritance patterns. However the nature of those ‘factors’ which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these ‘factors’ represent the genetic basis of inheritance, understanding the structure of genetic material and the structural basis of genotype and phenotype conversion became the focus of attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of molecular biology was a consequent development with major contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs (father and son), Benzer, Monod, Brenner, etc. A parallel problem being tackled was the mechanism of evolution. Awareness in the areas of molecular genetics, structural biology and bio informatics have enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of evolution. In this unit the structure and function of DNA and the story and theory of evolution have been examined and explained.</p>

			<p class="Normal83 para-style-override-3">James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928. In 1947, he received B.Sc. degree in Zoology. During these years his interest in bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in Zoology at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D. degree in 1950 on a study of the effect of hard X-rays on bacteriophage multiplication.</p>

			<p class="Normal83 para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-1" xml:lang="en-US">He met Crick and discovered their common interest in solving the DNA structure. Their first serious effort, was unsatisfactory. Their second effort based upon more experimental evidence and better appreciation of the nucleic acid literature, resulted, early in March 1953, in the proposal of the complementary double-helical configuration.</span><span class="char-style-override-1" xml:lang="en-US"></span></p>
			<p class="Normal83 para-style-override-3">Francis Harry Compton Crick was born on 8 June 1916, at Northampton, England. He studied physics at University College, London and obtained a B.Sc. in 1937. He completed Ph.D. in 1954 on a thesis entitled “X-ray Diffraction: Polypeptides and Proteins”.</p>
			<p class="Normal83 para-style-override-6">A critical influence in Crick’s career was his friendship with J. D. Watson, then a young man of 23, leading in 1953 to the proposal of the double-helical structure for DNA and the replication scheme. Crick was made an F.R.S. in 1959. </p>
			<p class="Normal83 para-style-override-6">The honours to Watson with Crick include: the John Collins Warren Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital, in 1959; the Lasker Award, in 1960; the Research Corporation Prize, in 1962 and above all, the Nobel Prize in 1962.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10">These and several related questions are dealt with, scientifically, in a branch of biology known as Genetics. This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the variation of characters from parents to offspring. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual reproduction. They exploited the variations that were naturally present in the wild populations of plants and animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that possessed desirable characters. For example, through </span><span>artificial selection and domestication from ancestral wild cows</span><span>, we have well-known Indian breeds, e.g., Sahiwal cows in Punjab. We must, however, recognise that though our ancestors knew about the inheritance of characters and variation, they had very little idea about the scientific basis of these phenomena.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>It was during the mid-nineteenth century that headway was made in the understanding of inheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted hybridi</span><span>sation experiments on garden peas for seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the laws of inheritance in living organisms. During Mendel’s investigations into inheritance patterns it was for the first time that statistical analysis and mathematical logic were applied to problems in biology. His experiments had a large sampling size, which gave greater credibility to the data that he collected. Also, the confirmation of his inferences from experiments on successive generations of his test plants, proved that his results pointed to general rules of inheritance rather than being unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated characters in the garden pea plant that were manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or dwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This allowed him to set up a basic framework of rules governing inheritance, which was expanded on by later scientists to account for all the diverse natural observations and the complexity inherent in them. </span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text">Mendel conducted such artificial pollination/cross pollination experiments using several  true-breeding pea lines. A true-breeding line is one that, having undergone continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and expression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea plant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted green or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 5.1, Table 5.1).</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>Let us take the example of one such hybridisation experiment carried out by Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea plants to study the inheritance of one gene (Figure 5.2). He collected the seeds produced as a result of this cross and grew them to generate plants of the first hybrid generation. This generation is also called the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Filial</span><span class="char-style-override-6">1</span><span class="char-style-override-5"> progeny </span><span>or the</span><span class="char-style-override-5"> F</span><span class="char-style-override-6">1</span><span>.&#160;</span></p>

<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>Mendel observed that all the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1 </span><span> progeny  plants were tall, like one of its parents; none were dwarf (Figure 5.3). He made similar observations for the other pairs of traits – he found that the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1 </span><span> always resembled either one of the parents, and that the trait of the other parent was not seen in them.</span></p>

</div>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>M</span><span>endel then self-pollinated the tall F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> plants and to his surprise found  that in the Filial</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> generation some of the offspring were ‘dwar</span><span>f</span><span>’; the character that was not seen in the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> generation was now expressed. The proportion of plants that were dwarf were 1/4</span><span class="char-style-override-8">th</span><span> of the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> plants while 3/4</span><span class="char-style-override-8">th</span><span> of the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> plants were tall. The tall and dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-between height (Figure 5.3).</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied: only one of the parental traits was expressed in the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> generation while at the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> stage both the traits were exp</span><span>ressed in the proportion 3:1. The contrasting traits did not show any blending at either F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> or F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> stage.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Based on these observations, Mendel proposed that something was being stably passed down, unchanged, from parent to offspring through the gametes, over successive generations. He called these things as ‘factors’. Now we call them as </span><span class="char-style-override-5">genes</span><span>. Genes, therefore, are the units of inheritance. They contain the information that is required to express a particular trait in an organism. Genes which code for a pair of contrasting traits are known as </span><span class="char-style-override-5">alleles,</span><span> i.e., they are slightly different forms of the same gene.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>If we use  alphabetical symbols for each gene, then the capital letter is used for the trait expressed at the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> stage and the small alphabet for the other trait. For example, in case of the character of height, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> is used for the Tall trait and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span><span>for the ‘dwar</span><span>f</span><span>’, and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span> are alleles of each other. Hence, in plants the pair of alleles for height would be </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt</span><span>. Mendel also proposed that in a true breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety the allelic pair of genes for height are identical or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">homozygous</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt</span><span>, respectively. </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt</span><span> are called the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">genotype</span><span> of the plant while the descriptive terms </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tall</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">dwarf</span><span> are the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">phenotype</span><span>. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a genotype </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span>?</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>As Mendel found the phenotype of the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1 </span><span>heterozygote </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span> to be exactly like the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar factors, one dominates the other (as in the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1 </span><span>) and hence is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">dominant</span><span> factor while the other factor is </span><span class="char-style-override-5">recessive</span><span> . In this case </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> (for tallness) is dominant over </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t </span><span>(for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed identical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>It is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an alphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and recessiveness. (Do not use </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> for tall and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">d</span><span> for dwarf because you will <br/>find it difficult to remember whether </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">d</span><span> are alleles of the same&#160;gene/character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt</span><span> or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span>. Since the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span> plant is heterozygous for genes controlling one character (height), it is a </span><span class="char-style-override-5">monohybrid</span><span> and the cross between </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt</span><span> is a </span><span class="char-style-override-5">monohybrid cross</span><span>. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>From the observation that the recessive parental trait is expressed without any blending in the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> generation, we can infer that, when the tall and dwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of meiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">segregate</span><span> from each other and only one allele is transmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles is a random process and so there is a 50 per cent chance of a gamete containing either allele, as has been verified by the results of the crossings. In this way the gametes of the tall </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT </span><span>plants have the allele </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> and the gametes of the dwarf </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt </span><span>plants have the allele </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span>. During fertilisation the two alleles, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> from one parent say, through the pollen, and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span> from the other parent, then through the egg, are united to produce zygotes that have one </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> allele and one </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span> allele.  In other words the hybrids have </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span>. Since these hybrids contain alleles which express contrasting traits, the plants are </span><span class="char-style-override-5">heterozygous</span><span>. The production of gametes by the parents, the formation of the zygotes, the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> and F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> plants can be understood from a diagram called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Punnett Square</span><span> as shown in Figure 5.4. It was developed by a British geneticist, Reginald C. Punnett. It is a graphical representation to calculate the probability of all possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross. The possible gametes are written on two sides, usually the top row and left columns. All  possible combinations are represented in boxes below in the squares, which generates a square output form. </span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4</span><span class="char-style-override-8">th</span><span> of the random fertilisations lead to </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span>, 1/2 lead to </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span> and 1/4</span><span class="char-style-override-8">th</span><span class="char-style-override-12"> </span><span>to </span><span class="char-style-override-5">tt</span><span>. Though the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> have a genotype of </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span>, but the phenotypic  character seen is ‘tall’. At F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span>, 3/4</span><span class="char-style-override-8">th</span><span class="char-style-override-12"> </span><span>of the plants are tall, where some of them are </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> while others are </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span>. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between  the plants with the genotypes </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span>. Hence, within the genopytic pair </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span> only one character ‘</span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span>’ tall is expressed. Hence the character </span><span class="char-style-override-5">T</span><span> or ‘tall’ is said to dominate over the other allele </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span> or ‘dwar</span><span>f</span><span>’ character.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-16"><span>From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it  is not possible to know the genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> or F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> has </span><span class="char-style-override-5">TT</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Tt</span><span> composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine the genotype of a tall plant at F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span>, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> with a dwarf plant. This he called a </span><span class="char-style-override-5">test cross</span><span>. In a typical test cross an organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to predict the genotype of the test organism.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span class="char-style-override-5">Explanation of the concept of dominance</span><span>: What exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles dominant and some recessive? To tackle these questions, we must understand what a gene does. Every gene, as you know by now, contains the information to express a particular trait. In a diploid organism, there are two copies of each gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles need not always be identical, as in a heteroz</span><span>ygote. One of them may be different due to some changes that it has undergone (about which you will read further on, and in the next chapter) which modifies the information that particular allele contains. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-19">Let’s take an example of a gene that contains the information for producing an enzyme. Now there are two copies of this gene, the two allelic forms. Let us assume (as is more common) that the normal allele produces the normal enzyme that is needed for the transformation of a substrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for production of –</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-19">	(i)	the normal/less efficient enzyme, or </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-19">	(ii)	a non-functional enzyme, or </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-19">	(iii)	no enzyme at all</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>In the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele</span><span>,</span><span> i.e.</span><span>,</span><span> it will produce the same phenotype/trait</span><span>,</span><span> i.e.</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>result in the transformation of substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the allele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may be effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning of the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced. </span><span class="char-style-override-5"></span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Do you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides a good example of </span><span class="char-style-override-5">multiple alleles</span><span>? Here you  can see that there are more than two, i.e.,  three alleles, governing the same character. Since in an individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found only when population studies are made.</span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Occasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect. For example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It has two alleles (</span><span class="char-style-override-5">B</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">b</span><span>). Starch is synthesised effectively by </span><span class="char-style-override-5">BB </span><span>homozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">bb</span><span> homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce smaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, </span><span class="char-style-override-5">BB</span><span> seeds are round and the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">bb</span><span> seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and so </span><span class="char-style-override-5">B</span><span> seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are of intermediate size in </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Bb</span><span> seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as the phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete dominance. </span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Therefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the product that it has information for.

Consider the segregation of one pair of genes </span><span class="char-style-override-5">R</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-5">r</span><span>. Fifty per cent of the gametes have the gene </span><span class="char-style-override-5">R</span><span> and the other 50 per cent have </span><span class="char-style-override-5">r</span><span>. Now besides each gamete having either </span><span class="char-style-override-5">R</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">r</span><span>, it should also have the allele </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Y</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">y</span><span>.  The important thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent </span><span class="char-style-override-5">R</span><span> and 50 per cent </span><span class="char-style-override-15">r</span><span> is </span><span class="char-style-override-9">independent</span><span> from the segregation of 50 per cent </span><span class="char-style-override-5">Y</span><span> and 50 per cent </span><span class="char-style-override-5">y</span><span>.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>Mendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865 but for several reasons</span><span>, it remained unrecognised till 1900. Firstly, communication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work could not be widely publicised.  Secondly, his concept of </span><span class="char-style-override-5">genes</span><span> (or </span><span class="char-style-override-5">factors</span><span>, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled the expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’ with each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an explanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature. Thirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological phenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the biologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that factors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical proof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>In 1900, three Scientists (d</span><span>e</span><span> Vries, Correns and von Tschermak) independently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of characters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that were taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division. This led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to double and divide just before each cell division. These were called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">chromosomes</span><span> (</span><span class="char-style-override-9">colored bodies</span><span>, as they were visualised by staining). By 1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out. Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used chromosome movement (Figure 5.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 5.3). Recall that you have studied the behaviou</span><span>r of chromosomes during mitosis (equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The important things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes occur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous sites on homologous chromos</span><span>omes. </span></p>

The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried out by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridi</span><span>s</span><span>ed yellow-bodied, white-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">1</span><span> progeny.  He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently of each other and the F</span><span class="char-style-override-7">2</span><span> ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1 ratio (expected when the </span><span>two</span><span> genes are independent). </span><span class="char-style-override-11"></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X chromosome (</span><span>Section 5.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental type.  Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage of the two genes and coined the term </span><span class="char-style-override-5">linkage</span><span> to describe this physical association of genes on a chromosome and the term </span><span class="char-style-override-5">recombination</span><span> to describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 5.11). Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped on  the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed very low recombination) (Figure 5.11, Cross A) while others were loosely linked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 5.11, Cross B). For example he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked and showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span><span>and miniature wing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes and ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>Mendel’s studies mainly described those traits that have distinct alternate forms such as flower colour which are either purple or white. But if you look around you will find that there are many traits which are not so distinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example, in humans we don’t just have tall or short people as two distinct alternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally controlled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits. Besides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes into account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another classic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the contribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To understand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin colour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for dark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour. The genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest skin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the lightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles and three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this manner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine the darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-31"><span>We have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait. There are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple phenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The underlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene on metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes. An example of this is the disease&#160;phenylketonuria, which occurs in humans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests itself through phenotypic expression characterised by&#160;mental retardation&#160;and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>The mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the geneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism of sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried out in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of insects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal basis of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could trace a specific nuclear structure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also observed by him that 50 per  cent of the sperm received this structure after spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive it. Henking gave a name to this structure as the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">X body</span><span> but he could not explain its significance. Further investigations by other scientists led to the conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was in fact a chromosome and that is why it was given the name X-chromosome. It was also observed that in a large number of insects the mechanism of sex determination is of the XO type, i.e., all eggs bear an additional X-chromosome besides the other chromosomes (autosomes). On the other hand, some of the sperms bear the X-chromosome whereas some do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having an X-chromosome become females and, those fertilised by sperms that do not have an X-chromosome become males. </span><span class="char-style-override-9">Do you think the number of chromosomes in the male and female are equal?</span><span> Due to the involvement of the X-chromosome in the determination of sex, it was designated to be the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">sex chromosome</span><span>, and the rest of the chromosomes were named as </span><span class="char-style-override-5">autosomes</span><span>.Grasshopper is an example of XO type of sex determination in which the males have only one X-chromosome besides the autosomes, whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>These observations led to the investigation of a number of species to understand the mechanism of sex determination. In a number of other insects and mammals including man, XY type of sex determination is seen where both male and female have same number of chromosomes. Among the males an X-chromosome is present but its counter part is distinctly smaller and called the Y-chromosome. Females, however, have a pair of X-chromosomes. Both males and females bear same number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY, while female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings  and in </span><span class="char-style-override-9">Drosophila</span><span> the males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 5.12 a, b)</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>In the above description you have studied about two types of sex determining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type.

Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated to be the example of </span><span class="char-style-override-5">male heterogamety</span><span>. In some other organisms, e.g., birds, a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure 5.12 c). In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both males and females.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9">It has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas the presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male characteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides the autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the ovum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome. In case the ovum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome carrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent probability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in our society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and have been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9">The sex determination in honey bee is based on the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female (queen or worker), and an unfertilised egg develops as a male (drone) by means of parthenogenesis. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes than that of a female. The females are diploid having 32 chromosomes and males are haploid, i.e., having 16 chromosomes. This is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special characteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis (Figure 5.13), they do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but have a grandfather and can have grandsons.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10">As you will learn in Chapter 6, one DNA helix runs continuously from one end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form. Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of DNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be located on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10"><span>In addition to the above, mutation also arise due to change in a </span><span>single base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classical example of such a mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions of base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations (see Chapter 6).</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10">The mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope of this discussion, at this level. However, there are many chemical and physical factors that induce mutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV radiations can cause mutations in organisms – it is a mutagen.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-9"><span>The idea that disorders are inherited has been prevailing in the human society since long. This was based on the heritability of certain characteristic features in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s work the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of traits in human beings began. Since it is evident that control crosses that can be performed in pea plant or some other organisms, are not possible in case of human beings, study of the family history about inheritance of a particular trait provides an alternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-5">pedigree analysis</span><span>. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance of a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10">In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease.  Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis have been shown in Figure 5.13.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-10">As you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any organism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present in the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence transmitted from one generation to the other without any change or alteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such an alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation. A number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated with the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes. </p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-40"><span>Broadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories – Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly determined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders are transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in the principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian disorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common and prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-cell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is important to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be dominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand whether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is evident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier </span><span>female to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 5.14</span><span> for dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design pedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.</span></p>

It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and only about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to red-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only one X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who</span> carries the gene has a 50 per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is not herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its effect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene. A daughter will not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her father is colour blind.<span></span></p>

In this disease, a single protein that is a part of the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding. The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease to sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family pedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents as she was a carrier of the disease.</p>

The disease is controlled by a single pair of allele, Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">A</span> and Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">S</span>. Out of the three possible genotypes only homozygous individuals for Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">S</span> (Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">S</span>Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">S</span>) show the diseased phenotype. Heterozygous (Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">A</span>Hb<span class="char-style-override-8">S</span>) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they are carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission of the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait (Figure 5.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid (Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin protein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the beta globin gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like structure (Figure 5.15). </p>

This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin molecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease.

While <span class="char-style-override-22">b</span> Thalassemia is controlled by a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent and occurs due to mutation of one or both the genes. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell anaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too few globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of synthesising an incorrectly functioning globin.</p>

			<p class="Summary-heading para-style-override-50" style="text-align: center;"><span class="char-style-override-25"><b>SUMMARY</b></span></p>
			<p class="Summary-Text"><span class="char-style-override-26">Genetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance and its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and physiolog</span><span class="char-style-override-26">ical features has attracted the attention of many biologists. Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While studying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting characters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are today referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that the ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found in pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the characters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in differen</span><span class="char-style-override-26">t–</span><span class="char-style-override-26">first generations (F</span><span class="char-style-override-27">1</span><span class="char-style-override-26">), second (F</span><span class="char-style-override-27">2</span><span class="char-style-override-26">) and so on. Some characters are dominant over others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are in heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters are only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never blend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not expressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it becomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of gametes (Law of Segregation). </span></p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-51">Not all characters show true dominance. Some characters show incomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors independently assort and combine in all permutations and combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known as ‘Punnett Square’.  The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes regulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical expression of the chraracters is called phenotype.</p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-51">After knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a good correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were extended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it was found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These genes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement of genes on a chromosome. </p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-51">Many genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked genes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of chromosomes which were common, and another set which was different. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were named as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as autosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in male are ZZ, and in females are ZW. </p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-52"><span class="char-style-override-26">Mutat</span><span class="char-style-override-26">ion is defined as change in the genetic material. A point  mutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is caused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of hemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a pedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of chromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number (aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of genetic disorders. Down’s syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21, where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the total number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X chromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO, and in Klinefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied by analysis of Karyotypes.</span></p>
