			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-1">As you are aware, humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The reproductive events in humans include formation of gametes (gametogenesis), i.e., sperms in males and ovum in females, transfer of sperms into the female genital tract (insemination) and fusion of male and female gametes (fertilisation) leading to formation of zygote. This is followed by formation and development of blastocyst and its attachment to the uterine wall (implantation), embryonic development (gestation) and delivery of the baby (parturition). You have learnt that these reproductive events occur after puberty. There are remarkable differences between the reproductive events in the male and in the female, for example, sperm formation continues even in old men, but formation of ovum ceases in women around the age of fifty years. Let us examine the male and female reproductive systems in human. </p>

The epididymis leads to vas</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span>deferens that ascends to the abdomen and loops over the urinary bladder. It receives a duct from seminal vesicle and opens into urethra as the ejaculatory duct (Figure 3.1a). These ducts store and transport the sperms from the testis to the outside through urethra. The urethra originates from the urinary bladder and extends through the penis to its external opening called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">urethral meatus</span><span>. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>The penis is the male external genitalia (Figure 3.1a, b).

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>The oviducts (fallopian tubes), uterus and vagina constitute the female accessory ducts. Each fallopian tube is about 10-12 cm long and extends from the periphery of each ovary to the uterus (Figure 3.3b), the part closer to the ovary is the funnel-shaped </span><span class="char-style-override-2">infundibulum</span><span>. The edges of the infundibulum possess finger-like projections called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">fimbriae</span><span>, which help in collection of the ovum after ovulation.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>The uterus is single and it is also called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">womb</span><span>. The shape of the uterus is like an inverted pear. It is supported by ligaments attached to the pelvic wall. The uterus opens into vagina through a narrow cervix. The cavity of the cervix is called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">cervical canal </span><span>(Figure 3.3b) which alongwith vagina forms the birth canal. The wall of the uterus has three layers of tissue.</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> </span><span>The external thin membranous </span><span class="char-style-override-2">perimetrium, </span><span>middle</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> </span><span>thick layer of smooth muscle, </span><span class="char-style-override-2">myometrium</span><span> and inner glandular layer called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">endometrium</span><span> that lines the uterine cavity.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-1"><span>The primary sex organs </span><span>– the testis in the males and the ovaries in the female</span><span>s</span><span>–</span><span>produce gametes</span><span>, i.e, sperms and ovum, respectively, by the process called gametogenesis. In testis, the immature male germ cells (spermatogonia)</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span>produce sperms by </span><span class="char-style-override-2">spermatogenesis</span><span> that begins at puberty.  The </span><span class="char-style-override-2">spermatogonia </span><span>(sing. spermatogonium) present on the inside wall of seminiferous tubules multiply by mitotic division and increase in numbers. Each spermatogonium</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> </span><span>is diploid and contains 46 chromosomes. Some of the spermatogonia called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">primary spermatocytes</span><span> periodically undergo meiosis. A primary spermatocyte completes the first meiotic division (reduction division) leading to formation of two equal,  haploid cells called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">secondary spermatocytes</span><span>, which have only 23 chromosomes each.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Spermatogenesis starts at the age of puberty due to significant increase in the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). This, if you recall, is a hypothalamic hormone. The increased levels of GnRH then acts at the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates secretion of two </span><span>gonadotropins – luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  LH acts at the Leydig cells and stimulates synthesis and secretion of androgens. Androgens, in turn, stimulate the process of spermatogenesis. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells and stimulates secretion of some factors which help in the process of spermiogenesis.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Let us examine the structure of a sperm. It is a microscopic structure composed of a </span><span class="char-style-override-2">head</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-2">neck,</span><span> a </span><span class="char-style-override-2">middle piece</span><span> and a </span><span class="char-style-override-2">tail</span><span> (Figure 3.6). A plasma membrane envelops the whole body of sperm. The sperm head contains an elongated haploid nucleus, the anterior portion of which is covered by a cap-like structure, </span><span class="char-style-override-2">acrosome</span><span>. The acrosome is filled with enzymes that help fertilisation of the ovum. The middle piece possesses numerous mitochondria, which produce energy for the movement of  tail that facilitate sperm motility essential for fertilisation.  The human male ejaculates about 200 to 300 million sperms during a coitus of which, </span><span>for normal fertility</span><span>, at least 60 per cent sperms must have normal shape and size and at least 40 per cent of them must show vigorous motility.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Sperms released from the seminiferous tubules, are transported by the accessory ducts. Secretions of epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle and prostate are essential for maturation and motility of sperms. The seminal plasma along with the sperms constitute the </span><span class="char-style-override-2">semen</span><span>. The functions of male sex accessory ducts and glands are maintained by the testicular hormones (androgens). </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>The process of formation of a mature female gamete is called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">oogenesis</span><span> which is markedly different from spermatogenesis. Oogenesis is initiated during the embryonic development stage when a couple of million gamete mother cells (</span><span class="char-style-override-2">oogonia</span><span>) are formed within each fetal ovary; no more oogonia are formed and added after birth. These cells start division and enter into prophase-I of the meiotic division and get temporarily arrested at that stage, called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">primary oocytes</span><span>. Each primary oocyte then gets surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells and is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-2">primary follicle </span><span>(Figure 3.7). A large number of these follicles degenerate during the phase from birth to puberty. Therefore, at puberty only 60,000-80,000 primary follicles are left in each ovary. The primary follicles get surrounded by more layers of granulosa cells and a new theca and are called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">secondary follicles</span><span>.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-1"><span>The cycle starts with the menstrual phase, when menstrual flow occurs and it lasts for 3-5 days.</span><span> The menstrual flow results due to breakdown of endometrial lining of the uterus and its blood vessels which forms liquid that comes out through vagina. </span><span>Menstruation only occurs if the released </span><span>ovum is not fertilised. Lack of menstruation may be indicative of pregnancy. However, it may also be caused due to some other underlying causes like stress, poor health etc. </span><span>The menstrual phase is followed by the follicular phase. During </span><span>this phase, the primary follicles in the ovary grow to become a fully mature Graafian follicle and simultaneously the endometrium of uterus regenerates through proliferation. These changes in the ovary and the uterus are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones (Figure 3.</span><span>9</span><span>). The secretion of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) increases gradually during the follicular phase, and stimulates follicular development as well as secretion of estrogens by the growing follicles. Both LH and FSH attain a peak level in the middle of cycle (about 14</span><span class="char-style-override-3">th</span><span> day). Rapid secretion of LH leading to its maximum level during the mid-cycle called LH surge induces rupture of Graafian follicle and thereby the release of ovum (</span><span class="char-style-override-2">ovulation</span><span>). The ovulation (ovulatory phase) is followed by the luteal phase during which the remaining parts of the Graafian follicle transform as the </span><span class="char-style-override-2">corpus luteum</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> </span><span>(Figure 3.</span><span>9</span><span>). The corpus luteum secretes large amounts of </span><span>progesteron</span><span>e</span><span> which is essential for maintenance of the endometrium. Such a</span><span>n endometrium is necessary for implantation of the fertilised ovum and other events of pregnancy. </span><span>During</span><span> pregnancy all events of the menstrual cyc</span><span>l</span><span>e stop and there </span><span>is </span><span>no menstruation.  In the absence of fertilisation, the corpus luteum degenerates. This causes disintegration of the endometrium leading to menstruation</span><span>, marking a new cycle.  In human beings, menstrual cycles ceases around 50 years of age; that is termed as </span><span class="char-style-override-2">menopause</span><span>. Cyclic </span><span>menstruation</span><span> is an indicator of normal reproductive </span><span>phase and extends between menarche and menopause.</span><span></span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-1">During copulation (coitus) semen is released by the penis into the vagina (insemination). The motile sperms swim rapidly, pass through the cervix,  enter into the uterus and finally reach the ampullary region of the&#160;fallopian tube (Figure 3.11b). The ovum released by the ovary is also transported to the ampullary region where fertilisation takes place.  Fertilisation can only occur if the ovum and sperms are transported simultaneously to the ampullary region.  This is the reason why not all copulations lead to fertilisation and pregnancy.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>The process of fusion of a sperm with an ovum is called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">fertilisation</span><span>. During fertilisation, a sperm comes in contact with the </span><span class="char-style-override-4">zona pellucida</span><span> layer of the ovum  (Figure 3.10) and induces changes in the membrane  that block the entry of additional sperms.  Thus, it ensures that only one sperm can fertilise an ovum.  The secretions of the acrosome help the sperm enter into the cytoplasm of the ovum through the zona pellucida and the plasma membrane. This induces the completion of the meiotic division of the secondary oocyte. The second meiotic division is also unequal and results in the formation of a </span><span class="char-style-override-2">second polar body</span><span> and a haploid ovum (ootid). Soon the haploid nucleus of the sperms and that of the ovum fuse together to form a diploid </span><span class="char-style-override-2">zygote</span><span>.  </span><span class="char-style-override-4">How many chromosomes will be there in the zygote?</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>One has to remember that the sex of the baby has been decided at this stage itself. Let us see how</span><span>? As you know the chromosome pattern in the human female is XX and that in the male is XY. Therefore, all the haploid gametes (ova) produced by the female have the sex chromosome X whereas in the male gametes (sperms) the sex chromosome could be either X or Y, hence, 50 per cent of sperms carry the X chromosome while the other 50 per cent carry the Y. After fusion of the male and female gametes the zygote would carry either XX or XY depending on whether the sperm carrying X or Y fertilised the ovum. The zygote carrying XX would develop into a female baby and XY would form a male (you will learn more about the chromosomal patterns in Chapter 5). </span><span class="char-style-override-4">That is why, scientifically it is correct to say that the sex of the baby is determined by the father and not by the mother!</span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>The mitotic division  starts as the zygote moves through the isthmus of the oviduct called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">cleavage</span><span> towards the uterus (Figure 3.11) and forms 2, 4, 8, 16 daughter cells called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">blastomeres</span><span>. The embryo with 8 to 16 blastomeres is called a morula (Figure 3.11e). The morula continues to divide and transforms into blastocyst (Figure 3.11g) as it moves further into the uterus. The blastomeres in the blastocyst are arranged into an outer layer called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">trophoblast</span><span> and an inner group of cells attached to trophoblast called the </span><span class="char-style-override-2">inner cell</span><span> mass. The trophoblast layer then gets attached to the endometrium and the inner cell mass gets differentiated as the embryo. After attachment, the uterine cells divide rapidly and covers the blastocyst. As a result, the blastocyst becomes embedded in the endometrium of the uterus (Figure 3.11h). This is called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">implantation</span><span> and it leads to pregnancy.</span></p>

By the end of 12 weeks (first trimester), most of the major organ systems are formed, for example, the limbs and external genital organs are well-developed. The first movements of the foetus and appearance of hair on the head are usually observed during the fifth month. By the end of about  24 weeks (end of second trimester), the body is covered with fine hair, eye-lids separate, and eyelashes are formed.  By the end of nine months of pregnancy, the foetus is fully developed and is ready for delivery.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-1"><span>The average duration of human pregnancy is about 9 months </span><span>which is called the gestation period. Vigorous contraction of the uterus at the end of pregnancy causes expulsion/delivery of the foetus.

The signals for parturition originate from the fully developed foetus and the placenta which induce mild uterine contractions called </span><span class="char-style-override-2">foetal ejection reflex.</span><span> This triggers release of oxytocin from the maternal pituitary. Oxytocin acts on the uterine muscle and causes stronger uterine contractions, which in turn stimulates further secretion of oxytocin. The stimulatory reflex between the uterine contraction and oxytocin secretion continues resulting in stronger and stronger contractions. This leads to expulsion of the baby out of the uterus through the birth canal – parturition. Soon after the infant is delivered, the placenta is also expelled out of the uterus. </span><span class="char-style-override-4">What do you think the</span><span> </span><span class="char-style-override-4">doctors inject to induce delivery?</span><span> </span></p>

			<p class="Summary-heading para-style-override-2" style="text-align: center;"><span class="char-style-override-9"><b>SUMMARY</b></span></p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-16">Humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. The spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation, while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig cells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular hormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis. </p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-17">The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair of oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of mammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and some steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different stages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus and vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers namely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, hymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female secondary sexual characteristics. </p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-17">Spermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are transported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm is composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of formation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty). During ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.  After coitus, sperms are transported to the junction of the isthmus and ampulla, where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a diploid zygote. The presence of X or Y chromosome in the sperm determines the sex of the embryo. The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic division to form a blastocyst, which is implanted in the uterus resulting in pregnancy. After nine months of pregnancy, the fully developed  foetus is ready for delivery. The process of childbirth is called parturition which is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol, estrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy and secrete milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the mother (lactation) during the initial few months of growth.</p>
