			<p class="unit-text para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-1">Biology in essence is the story of life on earth. While individual organisms die without fail, species continue to live through millions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic extinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without which species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves its progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of reproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival advantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general principles underlying reproductive processes in living organisms and then explains the details of this process in flowering plants and humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related perspective on human reproductive health and how reproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to complete our understanding of biology of reproduction.</span><span class="char-style-override-1"></span></p>

			<p class="unit-text para-style-override-6">Born in November 1904 in Jaipur (Rajasthan) Panchanan Maheshwari  rose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India but of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education where he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired by Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest in Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that if his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction. These words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for his teacher in return. </p>
			<p class="unit-text para-style-override-7">He worked on embryological aspects and popularised the use of embryological characters in taxonomy. He established the Department of Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in embryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation of work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue culture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube fertilisation and intra-ovarian pollination won worldwide acclaim.</p>
			<p class="unit-text para-style-override-7">He was honoured with fellowship of Royal Society of London (FRS), Indian National Science Academy and several other institutions of excellence. He encouraged general education and made a significant contribution to school education by his leadership in bringing out the very first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published by NCERT in 1964.</p>

The period from birth to the natural death of an organism represents its </span><span class="char-style-override-6">life span. </span><span>Life spans of a few organisms are given in Figure 1.1. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Several other organisms are drawn for which you should find out their life spans and write in the spaces provided.</span><span>  Examine the life spans of organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both interesting and intriguing to note that it may be as short as a few days or as long as a few thousand years?  Between these two extremes are the life spans of most other living organisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are not necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of crows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans show a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much shorter life span as compared to a </span><span class="char-style-override-7">peepal </span><span>tree. Whatever be the life span, death of every individual organism is a certainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled organisms. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Why do we say there is no natural death in single-celled organisms? </span><span>Given this reality, have you ever wondered how vast number of plant and animal species have existed on earth for several thousands of years?  There must be some processes in living organisms that ensure this continuity.  Yes, we are talking about reproduction, something that we take for granted.  </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span class="char-style-override-6">Reproduction</span><span> is defined as a biological process in which an organism gives rise to young ones (offspring) similar to itself. The offspring grow, mature and in turn produce new offspring. Thus, there is a cycle of birth, growth and death. Reproduction enables the continuity of the species, generation after generation. You will study later in Chapter 5 (Principles of Inheritance and Variation) how genetic variation is created and inherited during reproduction.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>Let us see how widespread asexual reproduction is, among different groups of organisms.</span><span> Asexual reproduction is common among&#160;single-celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple organisations. In Protists and Monerans, the organism or the parent </span><span>cell divides</span><span> by mitosis</span><span> into two to give rise to new individuals </span><span>(Figure1.2). Thus, </span><span>in these organisms </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cell division</span><span> is itself a mode of reproduction. Many single-celled organisms reproduce by </span><span class="char-style-override-6">binary fission, </span><span>where a cell divides into two halves and each rapidly grows into an adult</span><span> </span><span>(e.g., </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Amoeba, Paramecium</span><span>).</span><span> </span><span>In yeast, the division is unequal and small </span><span class="char-style-override-6">buds </span><span>are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell which, eventually gets separated and  mature into new yeast organisms (c</span><span>ells).</span><span> Under unfavourable condition the Amoeba withdraws its pseudopodia and secretes a three-layered hard covering or cyst around itself. This phenomenon is termed as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">encystation</span><span>.&#160;</span></p>

<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>When favourable conditions return, the encysted Amoeba divides by multiple fission and produces many minute amoeba or pseudopodiospores; the cyst wall bursts out, and the spores are liberated in the surrounding medium to grow up into many amoebae. This phenomenon is known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">sporulation</span><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-13"><span>Members of the Kingdom Fungi and simple plants such as algae reproduce through special asexual reproductive structures (Figure 1.3). The most common of these structures are </span><span class="char-style-override-6">zoospores </span>that usually<span class="char-style-override-6"> </span>are microscopic motile structures.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span class="char-style-override-7">You have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI. What do you think – Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual reproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the offspring formed by vegetative reproduction?</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-13">While in animals and other simple organisms the term <span class="char-style-override-6">asexual</span> is used unambiguously, in plants, the term <span class="char-style-override-6">vegetative </span>reproduction is frequently used. In plants, the units of <span class="char-style-override-6">vegetative propagation</span> such as <span class="char-style-override-6">runner, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb </span><span>are all capable of giving rise to new offspring (Figure1.4). These structures are called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">vegetative</span><span> </span><span class="char-style-override-6">propagules. </span><span>Obviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two parents, the process involved is asexual. </span><span>In some organisms, if the body breaks into distinct pieces (fragments) each fragment grows into an adult capable of producing offspring (e.g., Hydra). This is also a mode of asexual reproduction called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">fragmentation</span><span>. </span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>You must have he</span><span>ard about the scourge of the water bodies or about the ‘terror of Bengal’. This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘water hyacinth’ which is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is standing water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of fishes.  You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may find it interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of its beautiful flowers and shape of leaves.  Since it can propagate vegetatively at a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period of time, it is very difficult to get rid off them. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>Are you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana,</span><span class="char-style-override-7"> </span><span>ginger, dahlia are cultivated?  Have you seen small plants emerging from the buds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and ginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new plantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably arise from the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">nodes</span><span> present in the modified stems of these plants. When the nodes come in contact with damp soil or water, they produce roots and new plants. Similarly, adventitious buds arise from the notches present at margins of leaves of </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Bryophyllum</span><span>.  This ability is fully exploited by gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>It is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method of reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation, like algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction just before the onset of adverse conditions.  </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Find out how sexual reproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable conditions?</span><span> </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions?</span><span> Asexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited by the higher plants. On the other hand, only sexual mode of reproduction is present in most of the animals.  </span><span class="char-style-override-7"></span></p>
			<h2 class="Chapter-text-heading para-style-override-13" id="sigil_toc_id_5"><span class="char-style-override-8">1.2 Sexual Reproduction</span><span></span></h2>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Sexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes, either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite sex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the new organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared to asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes, sexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical</span><span> to the parents or amongst themselves. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>A study of diverse organism</span><span>s</span><span>–</span><span>plants, animals or fung</span><span>i</span><span>–</span><span>show that though they differ so greatly in external morphology, internal structure and physiology, when it comes to sexual mode of reproduction, surprisingly, they share a similar pattern. Let us first discuss what features are common to these diverse organisms.  </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>All organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in their life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is called the</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> juvenile phase</span><span>. It is known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">vegetative phase </span><span>in plants. This phase is of variable durations in different organisms. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>The end of juvenile/vegetative phase which marks the beginning of  the reproductive phase can be seen easily in the higher plants when they come to flower. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">How long does it take for marigold/rice/wheat/coconut/mango plants to come to flower?</span><span>  </span><span class="char-style-override-7">In some plants, where flowering occurs more than once, what would you call the inter-flowering period – juvenile or mature?</span><span>  </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>Observe a few trees in your area. Do they flower during the same month year after year? Why do you think the availability of fruits like mango, apple, jackfruit, etc., is seasonal? Are there some plants that flower throughout the year and some others that show seasonal flowering?  </span><span><br/>Plant</span><span>s</span><span>–</span><span>the annual and biennial types, show clear cut vegetative, reproductive and senescent phases, but in the perennial species it is very difficult to clearly define these phases.</span><span> A few plants exhibit unusual flowering phenomenon; some of them such as bamboo species flower only once in their life time, generally after 50-100 years, produce large number of fruits  and die. Another plant, </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Strobilanthus kunthiana </span><span>(neelakuranji), flowers once in 12 years. As many of you would know, this plant flowered during September-October 2006. Its mass flowering transformed large tracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue stretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile phase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to active reproductive behaviour. The reproductive phase is also of variable duration in different organisms. </span><span class="char-style-override-7"></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span class="char-style-override-7">Can you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative of reproductive maturity?</span><span> </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>Among animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the year? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like frogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only seasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made to lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to reproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare.  The females of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of ovaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive phase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger, etc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">oestrus</span><span> </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cycle</span><span> where as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">menstrual cycle</span><span>. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions exhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive phase and are therefore called seasonal breeders. Ma</span><span>ny other mammals are reproductively active throughout their reproductive phase and hence are called continuous breeders. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>That we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we recognise. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">But what is meant by growing old? </span><span>The end of reproductive phase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old age. There are concomitant changes in the body (like slowing of metabolism, etc.) during this last phase of life span. Old age ultimately leads to death.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>In both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the transitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and certain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and the associated behavioural expressions of organisms.</span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-11"><span class="char-style-override-6">Events in sexual reproduction</span><span> </span><span>: </span><span>After attainment of maturity, all sexually reproducing organisms exhibit events and processes that have remarkable fundamental similarity, even though the structures associated with sexual reproduction are indeed very different. The events of sexual reproduction though elaborate and complex, follow a regular sequence.</span><span> </span><span>Sexual reproduction is characterised by the fusion (or fertilisation) of the male and female gametes</span><span>, the formation of zygote</span><span> and embryogenesis</span><span>. For convenience these sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely,</span><span> the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">pre-fertili</span><span class="char-style-override-6">s</span><span class="char-style-override-6">ation, fertili</span><span class="char-style-override-6">s</span><span class="char-style-override-6">ation</span><span> and the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">post-fertili</span><span class="char-style-override-6">s</span><span class="char-style-override-6">ation events. </span><span class="char-style-override-6"></span></p>

Exceptions are a few fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile (Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male gametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and pteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer takes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach the female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during transport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand times the number of female gametes produced.</span></p>

In bisexual, self-fertilising plants, e.g., peas, transfer of pollen grains to the stigma is relatively easy as anthers and stigma are located close to each other; pollen grains soon after they are shed, come in contact with the stigma. But in cross pollinating plants (including dioecious plants), a specialised event called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">pollination</span><span> facilitates transfer of pollen grains to the stigma. Pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the pollen tubes carrying the male gametes reach the ovule and discharge male gametes near the egg.  In dioecious animals, since male and female gametes are formed in different individuals, the organism must evolve a special mechanism for gamete transfer.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>T</span><span>he most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps the fusion of gametes. This process called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">syngamy</span><span> results in the formation of</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>a diploid</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> zygote</span><span>. The term </span><span class="char-style-override-6">fertilisation</span><span> is also often used for this process. The terms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used though , interchangeably. </span><span class="char-style-override-7"></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span class="char-style-override-7">What would happen if syngamy does not occur?</span><span> </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>However, it has to be mentioned here that in some organisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards and birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes development to form new organisms without fertilisation. This phenomenon is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">parthenogenesis.</span><span> </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-6">Where does syngamy occur? </span><span> In most aquatic organisms, such  as a majority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians, syngamy occurs in the external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of the organism.  This type of gametic fusion is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">external</span><span> </span><span class="char-style-override-6">fertilisation</span><span>. Organisms exhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between the sexes and release a large number of gametes into the surrounding medium (water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy.  This happens in the bony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are produced. A major disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely vulnerable to predators threatening their survival up to adulthood.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>In many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such as reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside the body of the organism, hence the process is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">internal fertilisation.  </span><span>In all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they fuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation, the male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it. In these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there is a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants, however, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by pollen tubes.</span><span></span></p>

<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-29">Reproduction enables a species to live generation after generation. Reproduction in organisms can be broadly classified into asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion of gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals. The offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and can be referred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common asexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding&#160;and gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in&#160;lower animals.</p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-31"><span class="char-style-override-15">Prokaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by cell division or binary fission of the parent cell. In several aquatic and terrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners, rhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets</span><span class="char-style-override-15">, etc., are capable of giving rise to new offspring. This method of asexual reproduction is generally referred to as vegetative propagation.</span></p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-32">Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes. It is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction. Most of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method. Events of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and post-fertilisation events. Pre-fertilisation events include gametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events include the formation of zygote and embryogenesis.</p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-32">Organisms may be bisexual or unisexual. Sexuality in plants is varied, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse types of flowers. Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious. Flowers may be bisexual or unisexual flowers.</p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-31"><span class="char-style-override-15">Gametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic division except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis.</span><span class="char-style-override-15"></span></p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-31"><span class="char-style-override-15">Transfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction. It is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs by copulation</span><span class="char-style-override-15">&#160;or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process called pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen grains to the stigma.</span></p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-32">Syngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes. Syngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or internally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised cell called zygote.</p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-32">The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called embryogenesis. In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its formation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous. Embryonal protection and care are better in viviparous organisms.</p>
<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-33"><span class="char-style-override-15">In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of the next generation, the embryo.</span></p>
