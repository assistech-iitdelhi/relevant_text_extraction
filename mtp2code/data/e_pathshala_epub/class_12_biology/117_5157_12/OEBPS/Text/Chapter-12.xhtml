			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">Biotechnology, as you would have learnt from the previous chapter, essentially deals with industrial scale production of biopharmaceuticals and biologicals using genetically modified microbes, fungi, plants and animals. The applications of biotechnology include therapeutics, diagnostics, genetically modified crops for agriculture, processed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and energy production. Three critical research areas of biotechnology are:</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(i)	Providing the best catalyst in the form of improved organism usually a microbe or pure enzyme.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(ii)	Creating optimal conditions through engineering for a catalyst to act, and</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(iii)	Downstream processing technologies to purify the protein/organic compound.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">Let us now learn how human beings have used biotechnology to improve the quality of human life, especially in the field of food production and health.</p>
			<h2 class="Chapter-text-heading para-style-override-7" id="sigil_toc_id_2"><span class="char-style-override-3">12.1 Biotechnological Applications in Agriculture </span><span></span></h2>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">Let us take a look at the three options that can be thought  for increasing food production </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">	(i)	agro-chemical based agriculture; </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">	(ii)	organic agriculture; and </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>	(iii)	genetically engineered crop-based agriculture. </span><span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>The</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> Green Revolution </span><span>succeeded in tripling the food supply but yet it was not enough to feed the growing human population. Increased yields have partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly due to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals (fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world, agrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with existing varieties are not possible using conventional breeding. Is there any alternative path that our understanding of genetics can show so that farmers may obtain maximum yield from their fields? Is there a way to minimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their harmful effects on the environment are reduced? Use of genetically modified crops is a possible solution.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by manipulation are called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Genetically Modified Organisms</span><span> (</span><span class="char-style-override-4">GMO</span><span>). GM plants have been useful in many ways. Genetic modification has:</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(i)	made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, heat).</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(ii)	reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(iii)	helped to reduce post harvest losses.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(iv)	increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants (this prevents early exhaustion of fertility of soil).</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5">	(v)	enhanced nutritional value of food, e.g., golden rice, i.e., Vitamin ‘A’ enriched rice.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">In addition to these uses, GM has been used to create tailor-made plants to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches, fuels and pharmaceuticals.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>Some of the applications of biotechnology in agriculture that you will study in detail are the production of pest resistant plants, which could decrease the amount of pesticide used. Bt toxin is produced by a bacterium called </span><span class="char-style-override-5">B</span><span class="char-style-override-6">acillus </span><span class="char-style-override-5">t</span><span class="char-style-override-6">huringiensis</span><span> (</span><span class="char-style-override-4">Bt</span><span> for short).  Bt toxin gene has been cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide resistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a bio-pesticide. Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and soyabean etc.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-8"><span class="char-style-override-4">Bt Cotton:</span><span> Some strains of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Bacillus thuringiensis</span><span> produce proteins that kill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm), coleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes).  </span><span class="char-style-override-6">B. thuringiensis</span><span> forms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These crystals contain a toxic </span><span class="char-style-override-4">insecticidal protein</span><span>. Why does this toxin not kill the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Bacillus</span><span>? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive </span><span class="char-style-override-6">protoxins</span><span> but once an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form of toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and create pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death of the insect.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Specific Bt toxin genes were isolated from </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Bacillus thuringiensis</span><span> and incorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 12.1). The choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as most Bt toxins are insect-group specific.&#160;The toxin is coded by a gene </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cryIAc </span><span> named </span><span class="char-style-override-4">cry</span><span>. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins encoded by the genes </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cryIAc </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cryIIAb </span><span>control the cotton bollworms, that of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cryIAb </span><span>controls corn borer.</span></p>

A nematode </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Meloidegyne incognitia</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span>infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction in yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which was based on the process of </span><span class="char-style-override-4">RNA interference</span><span> (RNAi). RNAi takes place in all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method involves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA molecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing). The source of this  complementary RNA could be from an infection by viruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons) that replicate via an RNA intermediate.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Using </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Agrobacterium</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span>vectors, nematode-specific genes were introduced into the host plant (Figure 12.2). The introduction of DNA was such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host cells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double stranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi a</span><span>nd thus, silenced the specific mRNA of the nematode. </span><span>The consequence was that the parasite could not survive in a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic plant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 12.2).</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">The recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more effective therapeutic drugs. Further, the recombinant therapeutics do not induce unwanted immunological responses as is common in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources. At present, about 30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human-use the world over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Management of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at regular time intervals. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">What would a diabetic patient do if enough human-insulin was not available</span><span>? If you discuss this, you would soon realise that one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Would the insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as that secreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune response in the human body</span><span>?</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>Now, imagine if bacterium were available that could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes so simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make as much insulin as you need.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span class="char-style-override-7">Think about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic people or not. Why?</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Ins</span><span>uli</span><span>n used for dia</span><span>betes was earlier extracted from pancreas of slaughtered cattle and pigs. Insulin from an animal source, though caused some patients to develop allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign </span><span>protein.&#160;Insulin consists of two short polypeptide chains:</span><span> chain A and chain B, that are linked together by disulphide bridges (Figure 12.3). In mammals, including humans, insulin is synthesised as a pro-hormone (like a pro-enzyme, the pro-hormone also needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature and functional hormone) which contains an extra stretch called the </span><span class="char-style-override-4">C peptide</span><span>. This C peptide is not present in the mature insulin and is removed during maturation into insulin.The main challenge for production of insulin using rDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a mature form. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company prepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B, chains of human insulin and introduced them in plasmids of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">E. coli</span><span> to produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were produced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulfide bonds to form human insulin.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>If a</span><span> person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy be taken for such </span><span>a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this. Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a gene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo. Here genes are inserted into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease. Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into the individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate for the non-functional gene.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that they are not completely curative. As a first step towards gene therapy, lymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside the body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then introduced into these lymphocytes, which are  subsequently returned to the patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if the gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure.</span><span></span></p>
			<h3 class="chapter-text-subheading-70-blac" id="sigil_toc_id_6">12.2.3 Molecular Diagnosis</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">You know that for effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and understanding its pathophysiology is very important.  Using conventional methods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis, etc.) early detection is not possible. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) are some of the techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Presence of a pathogen (bacteria, viruses, etc.) is normally suspected only when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom. By this time the concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body. However, very low concentration of a bacteria or virus (at a time when the symptoms of the disease are not yet visible) can be detected by amplification of their nucleic acid by PCR. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Can you explain how PCR can detect very low amounts of DNA? </span><span>PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected AIDS patients. It is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected cancer patients too. It is a powerful techqnique to identify many other genetic disorders.  </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">A single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule (probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of cells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the mutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic film, because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction. Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens (proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised against the pathogen. </p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an extra (foreign) gene are known as </span><span class="char-style-override-4">transgenic animals</span><span>. Transgenic rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced, although over 95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Why are these animals being produced? How can man benefit from such modifications</span><span>? Let us try and explore some of the common reasons:  </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-5"><span>	(i)</span><span class="char-style-override-4">	</span><span class="char-style-override-5">Normal physiology and development:</span><span> Transgenic animals can be specifically designed to allow the study of how genes are regulated, and how they affect the normal functions of the body and its development, e.g., study of complex factors involved in growth such as insulin-like growth factor. By introducing genes from other species that alter the formation of this factor and studying the biological effects that result, information is obtained about the biological role of the factor in the body.</span></p>

Transgenic animals that produce useful biological products can be created by the introduction of the portion of DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as human protein (</span><span class="char-style-override-8">α</span><span>-1-antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU) and cystic fibrosis. In 1997, the first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced human protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk contained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk. </span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">The manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on any further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living organisms.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">Going beyond the morality of such issues, the biological significance of such things is also important. Genetic modification of organisms can have unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into the ecosystem.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Therefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as </span><span class="char-style-override-4">GEAC</span><span> (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of introducing GM-organisms for public services. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">The modification/usage of living organisms for public services (as food and medicine sources, for example) has also created problems with patents granted for the same.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6">There is growing public anger that certain companies are being granted patents for products and technologies that make use of the genetic materials, plants and other biological resources that have long been identified, developed and used by farmers and indigenous people of a specific region/country.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-6"><span>Rice is an important food grain, the presence of which goes back thousands of years in Asia’s agricultural history. There are an estimated 200,000 varieties of rice in India alone. The diversity of rice in India is one of the richest in the world. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique aroma and flavour and 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown in India. There is reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and poetry, as it has been grown for centuries. In 1997, an American company got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and Trademark Office. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new’ variety of Basmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had actually been der</span><span>ived from Indian farmer’s varieties. Indian Basmati was crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or a novelty. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that other people selling Basmati rice could be restricted by the patent. </span><span>Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and processes based on Indian traditional herbal medicines, e.g., turmeric neem. If we are not vigilant and we do not immediately counter these patent applications, other countries/individuals may encash on our rich legacy and we may not be able to do anything about it.</span><span></span></p>

Recombinant DNA technology has made it possible to engineer microbes, plants and animals such that they have novel capabilities. Genetically Modified Organisms have been created by using methods other than natural methods to transfer one or more genes from one organism to another, generally using techniques such as recombinant DNA technology.  </p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-17"><span>GM plants have been useful in increasing crop yields, reduce post-harvest losses and make crops more tolerant of stresses. There are several GM crop plants with improved nutritional value of foods and reduced the reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops).</span><span class="char-style-override-10"></span></p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-18">Recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more effective therapeutics. Since the recombinant therapeutics are identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted immunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was observed in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources. Human insulin is made in bacteria yet its structure is absolutely identical to that of the natural molecule.</p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-18">Transgenic animals are also used to understand how genes contribute to the development of a disease by serving as models for human diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s.</p>
			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-18">Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individual’s cells and tissues to treat diseases especially hereditary diseases. It does so by replacing a defective mutant allele with a functional one or gene targeting which involves gene amplification. Viruses that attack their hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as part of their replication cycle are used as vectors to transfer healthy genes or more recently portions of genes. </p>
