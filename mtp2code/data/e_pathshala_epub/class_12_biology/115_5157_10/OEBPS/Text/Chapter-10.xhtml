They also cause diseases in animals and plants. But this should not make you think that all microbes are harmful; several microbes are useful to man in diverse ways. Some of the most important contributions of microbes to human welfare are discussed in this chapter. </span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>You would be surprised to know that we use microbes or products derived from them everyday. A common example is the production of curd from milk. Micro-organisms such as </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Lactobacillus</span><span> and others commonly called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">lactic acid bacteria (LAB)</span><span> grow in milk and convert it to curd. During growth, the LAB produce acids that coagulate and partially digest the milk proteins. A small amount of curd added to the fresh milk as inoculum or starter contain millions of LAB, which at suitable temperatures multiply, thus converting milk to curd, which also improves its nutritional quality by increasing vitamin B</span><span class="char-style-override-8">12</span><span>. In our stomach too, the LAB play very beneficial role in checking disease-causing microbes.</span></p>

A number of</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>traditional drinks and foods are also made by fermentation by the microbes. ‘Toddy’, a traditional drink of some parts of southern India is made by fermenting sap from palms. Microbes are also used to ferment fish, soyabean and bamboo-shoots to make foods. Cheese, is one of the oldest food items in which microbes were used. Different varieties of cheese are known by their characteristic texture, flavour and taste, the specificity coming from the microbes used. For example, the large holes in ‘Swiss cheese’ are due to production of a large amount of CO</span><span class="char-style-override-8">2</span><span> by a bacterium named </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Propionibacterium sharmanii</span><span>.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Antibiotics produced by microbes are regarded as one of the most significant discoveries of the twentieth century and have greatly contributed towards the welfare of the human society. </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Anti</span><span> is a Greek word that means ‘against’, and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">bio</span><span> means ‘life’, together they mean ‘against life’ (in the context of disease causing organisms); whereas with reference to human beings, they are ‘pro life’ and not against. Antibiotics are chemical substances, which are produced by some microbes and can kill or retard the growth of other (disease-causing) microbes. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>You are familiar with the commonly used antibiotic Penicillin. Do you know that Penicillin was the first antibiotic to be discovered, and it was a chance discovery?  Alexander Fleming while working on </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Staphylococci</span><span>  bacteria, once observed a mould growing in one of his unwashed culture plates around which </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Staphylococci</span><span> could not grow. He found out that it was due to a chemical produced by the mould and he named it Penicillin after the mould </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Penicillium notatum.</span><span> However, its full potential as an effective antibiotic was established much later by Ernest Chain and Howard Florey. This antibiotic  was extensively used to treat American soldiers wounded in World War II. Fleming, Chain and Florey were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945, for this discovery.</span><span></span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Microbes are also used for commercial and industrial production of certain chemicals like organic acids, alcohols and enzymes. Examples of acid producers are </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Aspergillus niger</span><span> (a fungus) of citric acid, </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Acetobacter aceti</span><span> (a bacterium) of acetic acid; </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Clostridium butylicum</span><span> (a bacterium) of butyric acid and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Lactobacillus </span><span>(a bacterium) of lactic acid.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>Yeast (</span><span class="char-style-override-4">Saccharomyces cerevisiae) </span><span>is used for commercial production of ethanol. Microbes are also used for production of enzymes. Lipases are used in detergent formulations and are helpful in removing oily stains from the laundry. You must have noticed that bottled fruit juices bought from the market are clearer as compared to those made at home. This is because the bottled juices are clarified by the use of pectinases and proteases. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Streptococcus </span><span>and modified by genetic engineering is used as a ‘clot buster’ for removing clots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial infarction leading to heart attack. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>Another bioactive molecule, cyclosporin A, that is used as an immunosuppressive agent in organ-transplant patients, is produced by the fungus </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Trichoderma polysporum</span><span>. Statins produced by the yeast </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Monascus purpureus</span><span> have been commercialised as blood-cholesterol lowering agents.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-11"><span>We know that large quantities of waste water are generated everyday in cities and towns. A major component of this waste water is human excreta. This municipal waste-water is also called sewage. It contains large amounts of organic matter and microbes. Many of which are pathogenic. Have you ever wondered where this huge quantity of sewage or urban waste water is disposed off daily? This cannot be discharged into natural water bodies like rivers and streams directly – you can understand why. Before disposal, hence, sewage is treated in sewage treatment plants (STPs) to make it less polluting. Treatment of waste water is done by the </span><span>heterotrophic microbes naturally present in the sewage. This treatment is carried out in two stages:</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span class="char-style-override-6">Primary treatment</span><span> : These treatment steps basically involve physical removal of particles – large and small – from the sewage through filtration and sedimentation. These are removed in stages; initially, floating debris is removed by sequential filtration. Then the grit (soil and small pebbles) are removed by sedimentation. All solids that settle form the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">primary sludge</span><span>, and the supernatant forms the effluent.  The effluent from the primary settling tank is taken for secondary treatment.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span class="char-style-override-6">Secondary treatment or Biological treatment</span><span> : The primary effluent is passed into large aeration tanks (Figure 10.6) where it is constantly agitated mechanically and air is pumped into it. This allows vigorous growth of useful aerobic microbes into </span><span class="char-style-override-6">flocs</span><span> (masses of bacteria associated with fungal filaments to form mesh like structures). While growing, these microbes consume the major part of the organic matter in the effluent. This significantly reduces the</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> BOD (biochemical oxygen demand)</span><span> of the effluent. BOD refers to the amount of the oxygen that would be consumed if all the organic matter in one liter of water were oxidised by bacteria. The sewage water is treated till the BOD is reduced. The BOD test measures the rate of uptake of oxygen by micro-organisms in a sample of water and thus, indirectly, BOD is a measure of the organic matter present in the water. The greater the BOD of waste water, more is its polluting potential. </span></p>

</div>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>Once the BOD of sewage or waste water is reduced significantly, the effluent is then passed into a settling tank where the bacterial ‘flocs’ are allowed to sediment. This sediment is called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">activated sludge</span><span>. A small part of the activated sludge is pumped back into the aeration tank to serve as the inoculum. The remaining major part of the sludge is pumped into large tanks called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">anaerobic sludge digesters</span><span>. Here, other kinds of bacteria, which grow anaerobically, digest the bacteria and the fungi in the sludge. During this digestion, bacteria produce a mixture of gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These gases form </span><span class="char-style-override-6">biogas </span><span>and can be used as source of energy as it is inflammable. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>The effluent from the secondary treatment plant is generally released into natural water bodies like rivers and streams. An aerial view of such a plant is shown in Figure 10.7.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4">You can appreciate how microbes play a major role in treating millions of gallons of waste water everyday across the globe. This methodology has been practiced for more than a century now, in almost all parts of the world. Till date, no man-made technology has been able to rival the microbial treatment of sewage. </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4">You are aware that due to increasing urbanisation, sewage is being produced in much larger quantities than ever before. However the number of sewage treatment plants has not increased enough to treat such large quantities. So the untreated sewage is often discharged directly into rivers leading to their pollution and increase in water-borne diseases. </p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>The Ministry of Environment and Forests has initiated </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Ganga Action Plan </span><span>and </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Yamuna Action Plan</span><span> to save these major rivers of our country from pollution. Under these plans, it is proposed to build a large number of sewage treatment plants so that only treated sewage may be discharged in the rivers. A visit to a sewage treatment plant situated in any place near you would be a very interesting and educating experience. </span></p>
			<h2 class="Chapter-text-heading para-style-override-7" id="sigil_toc_id_8"><span class="char-style-override-7">10.4 Microbes in Production of Biogas</span><span></span></h2>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>Biogas is a mixture of gases (containing predominantly methane) produced by the microbial activity and which may be used as fuel. You have learnt that microbes produce different types of gaseous end-products during growth and metabolism. The type of the gas produced depends upon the microbes and the organic substrates they utilise. In the examples cited in relation to fermentation of dough, cheese making and production of beverages, the main gas produced was CO</span><span class="char-style-override-8">2.</span><span>. However, certain bacteria, which grow anaerobically on cellulosic material, produce large amount of methane along with CO</span><span class="char-style-override-8">2</span><span> and H</span><span class="char-style-override-8">2</span><span>. These bacteria are collectively called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">methanogens</span><span>, and one such common bacterium is </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Methanobacterium</span><span>.  These bacteria are commonly found in the anaerobic sludge during  sewage treatment. These bacteria are also present in the rumen (a part of stomach) of cattle. A lot of cellulosic material present in the food of cattle is also present in the rumen. In rumen, these bacteria help in the breakdown of cellulose and play an important role in the nutrition of cattle. </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Do you think we, human beings, are able to digest the celluose present in our foods? </span><span>Thus, the excreta (dung) of cattle, commonly called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">gobar</span><span>, is rich in these bacteria. Dung can be used for generation of biogas, commonly called </span><span class="char-style-override-4">gobar gas</span><span>.   </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>The biogas plant consists of a concrete tank (10-15 feet deep) in which bio-wastes are collected and a slurry of dung is fed. A floating cover is placed over the slurry, which keeps on rising as the gas is produced in the tank due to the microbial activity. The biogas plant has an outlet, which is connected to a pipe to supply biogas to nearby houses. The spent slurry is removed through another outlet and may be used as fert</span><span>iliser. Cattle dung is available in large quantities in rural areas where cattle are used for a variety of purposes. So biogas plants are more often built in rural areas. The biogas thus produced is used for cooking and lighting. The picture of a biogas plant is shown in Figure 10.8.</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>The technology of biogas production was developed in India mainly due to the efforts of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC).</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>If your school is situated in </span><span>a village or near a village, it would be very interesting to enquire if there are any biogas plants nearby.

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3">Biocontrol refers to the use of biological methods for controlling plant diseases and pests. In modern society, these problems have been tackled increasingly by the use of chemicals – by use of insecticides and pesticides. These chemicals are toxic and extremely harmful, to human beings and animals alike, and have been polluting our environment (soil, ground water), fruits, vegetables and crop plants. Our soil is also polluted through our use of weedicides to remove weeds.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span class="char-style-override-6">Biological control of pests and diseases: </span><span>In agriculture, there is a method of controlling pests that relies on natural predation rather than introduced chemicals. A key belief of the organic farmer is that biodiversity furthers health. The more variety a landscape has, the more sustainable it is. The organic farmer, therefore, works to create a system where the insects that are sometimes called pests are not eradicated, but instead are kept at manageable levels by a complex system of checks and balances within a living and vibrant ecosystem. Contrary to the ‘conventional’ farming practices which often use chemical methods to kill both useful and harmful life forms indiscriminately, this is a holistic approach that seeks to develop an understanding of the webs of interaction between the myriad of organisms that constitute the field f</span><span>auna and flora. The organic farmer holds the view that the eradication of the creatures that are often described as pests is not only possible, but also undesirable, for without them the beneficial predatory and parasitic insects which depend upon them as food or hosts would not be able to survive. Thus, the use of biocontrol measures will greatly reduce our dependence on toxic chemicals and pesticides. An important part of the biological farming approach is to become familiar with the various life forms that inhabit the field, predators as well as pests, and also their life cycles, patterns of feeding and the habitats that they prefer. This will help develop appropriate means of biocontrol.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>The very familiar beetle with red and black markings – the Ladybird, and Dragonflies are useful to get rid of aphids and mosquitoes, respectively. An example of microbial biocontrol agents that can be introduced in order to control butterfly caterpillars is the bacteria </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Bacillus thuringiensis </span><span>(often written as</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> B</span><span class="char-style-override-4">t</span><span>). These are available in sachets as dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees, where these are eaten by the insect larvae. In the gut of the larvae, the toxin is released and the larvae get killed. The bacterial disease will kill the caterpillars, but leave other insects unharmed. Because of the development of methods of genetic engineering in the last decade or so, the scientists have introduced </span><span class="char-style-override-4">B. thuringiensis</span><span> toxin genes into plants. Such plants are resistant to attack by insect pests. </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Bt-cotton</span><span> is one such example, which is being cultivated in some states of our country. You will learn more about this in chapter 12.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-3"><span>With our present day life styles environmental pollution is a major cause of concern. The use of the chemical fertilisers to meet the ever-increasing demand of agricultural produce has contributed significantly to&#160;this pollution. Of course,  we have now realised that there are problems associated with the overuse of</span><span> chemical fertilisers and there is a&#160;large pressure to switch to </span><span class="char-style-override-6">organic farming</span><span> – the use of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">biofertilisers</span><span>. Biofertilisers  are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of the soil. The main sources of biofertilisers are bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria. You have studied about the nodules on the roots of leguminous plants formed by the symbiotic association of </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Rhizobium</span><span>. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into organic forms, which is used by the plant as nutrient. Other bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen while free-living in the soil (examples </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Azospirillum</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Azotobacter</span><span>), thus enriching the nitrogen content of the soil. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-4"><span>Fungi are also known to form symbiotic associations with plants (</span><span class="char-style-override-6">mycorrhiza</span><span>). Many members of the genus </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Glomus</span><span>  form mycorrhiza. The fungal symbiont in these associations absorbs phosphorus from soil and passes it to the plant. Plants having such associations show other benefits also, such as resistance to root-borne pathogens, tolerance to salinity and drought, and an overall increase in plant growth and development. </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Can you tell what advantage the</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> fungus derives from this association? </span><span> </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text"><span>Cyanobacteria are autotrophic microbes widely distributed in aquatic and terrestrial environments many of which can fix atmospheric nitrogen, e.g. </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Anabaena</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Nostoc</span><span>, </span><span class="char-style-override-4">Oscillatoria,</span><span> etc. In paddy fields, cyanobacteria serve as an important biofertiliser. Blue green algae also add organic matter to the soil and increase its fertility. Currently, in our country, a number of biofertilisers are available commercially in the market and farmers use these regularly in their fields to replenish soil nutrients and to reduce dependence on chemical fertilisers.</span></p>

			<p class="Summary-heading para-style-override-13" style="text-align: center;"><span><b>SUMMARY</b></span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Summary-Text"><span class="char-style-override-11">Microbes are a very important component of life on earth. Not all microbes are pathogenic. Many microbes are very useful to human beings. We use microbes and microbially derived products almost every day. Bacteria called lactic acid bacteria (LAB) grow in milk to convert it into curd. The dough, which is used to make bread, is fermented by yeast called </span><span class="char-style-override-12">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</span><span class="char-style-override-11">. Certain dishes such as </span><span class="char-style-override-12">idli </span><span class="char-style-override-11">and </span><span class="char-style-override-12">dosa</span><span class="char-style-override-11">, are made from dough fermented by microbes. Bacteria and fungi are used to impart particular texture, taste and flavor to cheese. Microbes are used to produce industrial products like lactic acid, acetic acid and alcohol, which are used in a variety of processes in the industry. Antibiotics like penicillins produced by useful microbes are used to kill disease-causing harmful microbes. Antibiotics have played a major role in controlling infectious diseases like diphtheria, whooping cough and pneumonia. For more than a hundred years, microbes are being used to treat sewage (waste water) by the process of activated sludge formation and this helps in recycling of water in nature. Methanogens produce methane (biogas) while degrading plant waste. Biogas produced by microbes is used as a source of energy in rural areas. Microbes can also be used to kill harmful pests, a process called as biocontrol. The biocontrol measures help us to avoid heavy use of toxic pesticides for controlling pests. There is a need these days to push for use of biofertilisers in place of chemical fertilisers.  It is clear from the diverse uses human beings have put microbes to that they play an important role in the welfare of human society.</span></p>
