<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-2"><span class="char-style-override-1">E</span><span class="char-style-override-1">ver since the days of Rene Descartes, the&#160;</span><span class="char-style-override-1">French philosopher, mathematician and biologist of seventeenth century, all human knowledge especially natural sciences were directed to develop technologies which add to the creature comforts of human lives, as also value to human life. The whole approach to understanding natural phenomena became anthropocentric. Physics and chemistry gave rise to engineering, technologies and industries which all worked for human comfort and welfare. The major utility of the biological world is as a source of food. Biotechnology, the twentieth century off-shoot of modern biology, changed our daily life as its products brought qualitative improvement in health and food production. The basic principles underlying biotechnological processes and some applications are highlighted and discussed in this unit.</span><br/></div>

			<p class="H1 para-style-override-2" style="text-align: center;">(1936 )</p>
		
			<p class="Normal para-style-override-3" style="text-align: justify;">Herbert Boyer was born in 1936 and brought up in a corner of western Pennsylvania where railroads and mines were the destiny of most young men. He completed graduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, in 1963, followed by three years of post-graduate studies at Yale.</p>
			<p class="Normal para-style-override-8" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US">In 1966, Boyer took over assistant professorship at the University of California at San Francisco. By 1969, he performed studies on a couple of restriction enzymes of the </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">E. coli</span><span class="char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US"> bacterium with especially useful properties. Boyer observed that these enzymes have the capability of cutting DNA strands in a particular fashion, which left what has became known as ‘sticky ends’ on the strands. These clipped ends made pasting together pieces of DNA a precise exercise. </span></p>
			<p class="Normal para-style-override-9" style="text-align: justify;">This discovery, in turn, led to a rich and rewarding conversation in Hawaii with a Stanford scientist named Stanley Cohen. Cohen had been studying small ringlets of DNA called plasmids and which float  about freely in the cytoplasm of certain bacterial cells and  replicate independently from the coding strand of DNA. Cohen had developed a method of removing these plasmids from the cell and then reinserting them in other cells. Combining this process with that of DNA splicing enabled Boyer and Cohen to recombine segments of DNA in desired configurations and insert the DNA in bacterial cells, which could then act as manufacturing plants for specific proteins. This breakthrough was the basis upon which the discipline of biotechnology was founded.<span style="text-align: center;">&#160;</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span class="char-style-override-6">Biotechn</span><span class="char-style-override-6">ology</span> deals with techniques of using live organisms or enzymes from organisms to produce products and processes useful to humans. In this sense, making curd, bread or wine, which are all microbe-mediated processes, could also be thought as a form of biotechnology. However, it is used in a restricted sense today, to refer to such of those processes which use genetically modified organisms to achieve the same on a larger scale. Further, many other processes/techniques are also included under biotechnology. For example, <span class="char-style-override-7">in vitro </span>fertilisation leading to a ‘test-tube’ baby, synthesising a gene and using it, developing a DNA vaccine or correcting a defective gene, are all part of biotechnology.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">The European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) has given a definition of biotechnology that encompasses both traditional view and modern molecular biotechnology. The definition given by EFB is as follows:</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">‘The integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services’.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12">Among many, the two core techniques that enabled birth of modern biotechnology are :</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-14">(i)	<span class="char-style-override-10">Genetic engineerin</span><span class="char-style-override-10">g</span><span class="char-style-override-7"> :</span><span> Techniques to alter the chemistry of genetic material (DNA and RNA), </span><span>to introduce these into host organisms and thus change the phenotype of the host organism.</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">Let us now understand the conceptual development of the  principles of genetic engineering.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>You probably appreciate the advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction. The former provides opportunities for variations and formulation of unique combinations of genetic setup, some of which may be beneficial to the organism as well as the population. Asexual reproduction preserves the genetic information, while sexual reproduction permits variation. Traditional hybridisation procedures used in plant and animal breeding, very often lead to inclusion and multiplication of undesirable genes along with the desired genes. The techniques of genetic engineering which include creation of  </span><span class="char-style-override-6">recombinant DNA</span><span>, use of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">gene cloning</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-6">gene transfer</span><span>, overcome this limitation and allows us to isolate and introduce only one or a set of desirable genes without introducing undesirable genes into the target organism.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>Do you know the likely fate of a piece of DNA, which is somehow transferred into an alien organism? Most likely, this piece of DNA would not be able to multiply itself in the progeny cells of the organism. But, when it gets integrated into the genome of the recipient, it may multiply and be inherited along with the host DNA.  This is because the alien piece of DNA has become part of a chromosome, which has the ability to replicate.  In a chromosome there is a specific DNA sequence called the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">origin of replication,</span><span> which is responsible for initiating replication. Therefore, for the multiplication of any alien piece of DNA in an organism it needs to be a part of a chromosome(s) which has a specific sequence known as ‘origin of replication’. Thus, an alien DNA is linked with the origin of replication, so that, this alien piece of DNA can replicate and multiply itself in the host organism. This can also be called as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cloning</span><span> or making multiple identical copies of any template DNA.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>Let us now focus on the first instance of the construction of an artificial recombinant DNA molecule. The construction of the first recombinant DNA emerged from the possibility of linking a gene encoding antibiotic resistance with a native </span><span class="char-style-override-6">plasmid </span><span>(autonomously replicating circular extra-chromosomal DNA) of </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Salmonella typhimurium</span><span>. Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer accomplished this in 1972 by isolating the antibiotic resistance gene by cutting out a piece of DNA from a plasmid which was responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance. The cutting of DNA</span><span> at specific locations became po</span><span>s</span><span>sible with </span><span>the discovery of the so-called ‘molecular scissors’– </span><span class="char-style-override-6">restriction enzymes</span><span>. The cut piece of DNA was then linked with the plasmid DNA. These plasmid DNA act as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">vectors</span><span> to transfer the piece of DNA attached to it.  You probably know that mosquito acts as an insect vector to transfer the malarial parasite into human body. In the same way, a plasmid can be used as vector to deliver an alien piece of DNA into the host organism. The linking of antibiotic resistance gene with the plasmid vector became possible with the enzyme DNA ligase, which acts on cut DNA molecules and joins their ends. This makes a new combination of circular autonomously replicating DNA created </span><span class="char-style-override-7">in vitro</span><span> and is known as recombinant DNA. When this DNA is transferred into </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Escherichia coli</span><span>, a bacterium closely related to </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Salmonella,</span><span> it could replicate using the new host’s DNA polymerase enzyme and make multiple copies. The ability to multiply copies of antibiotic resistance gene in </span><span class="char-style-override-7"><br/>E. coli</span><span> was called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cloning</span><span> of antibiotic resistance gene in </span><span class="char-style-override-7">E. coli</span><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">You can hence infer that there are three basic steps in genetically modifying an organism —</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-16">	(i)	identification of DNA with desirable genes;</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-16">	(ii)	introduction of the identified DNA into the host;</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-16">	(iii)	maintenance of introduced DNA in the host and transfer of the DNA to its progeny.</p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12">Now we know from the foregoing discussion that genetic engineering or recombinant DNA technology can be accomplished only if we have the key tools, i.e., restriction enzymes, polymerase enzymes, ligases, vectors and the host organism. Let us try to understand some of these in detail.</p>
			<h3 class="Chapter-text--subheading-70blac" id="sigil_toc_id_6">11.2.1 Restriction Enzymes</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>In the year 1963, the two enzymes responsible for restricting the growth of bacteriophage in </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Escherichia coli </span><span>were isolated. One of these added methyl groups to DNA, while the other cut DNA. The later was called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">restriction endonuclease</span><span class="char-style-override-7">.</span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>The first restriction endonuclease–</span><span class="char-style-override-7">Hind II</span><span>, whose functioning depended on a specific DNA nucleotide sequence was isolated and characterised five years later. It was found that </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Hind II </span><span>always cut DNA molecules at a particular point by recognising a specific sequence of six base pairs. This specific base sequence is known as the </span><span class="char-style-override-6">recognition sequence</span><span> for </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Hind II</span><span>. Besides </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Hind II</span><span>, today we know more than 900 restriction enzymes that have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria each of which recognise different recognition sequences.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>The convention for naming these enzymes is the first letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which t</span><span>hey </span><span>were isolated, e.g., EcoRI comes fr</span><span>om </span><span class="char-style-override-7">E</span><span>s</span><span class="char-style-override-7">cherichia coli </span><span>RY 13. In EcoRI, the letter ‘R’ is derived from the name of strain. Roman numbers following the names indicate the order in which the enzymes were isolated from that strain of bacteria.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>Restriction enzymes belong to a larger class of enzymes called </span><span class="char-style-override-6">nucleases</span><span>. These are of two kinds; </span><span class="char-style-override-6">exonucleases</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-6">endonucleases</span><span>. Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of the DNA whereas, endonucleases make cuts at specific positions within the DNA.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>Each restriction endonuclease functions by ‘inspecting’ the length of a DNA sequence. Once it finds its specific recognition sequence, it&#160;will bind to the DNA and cut each of the two strands of the double&#160;helix at specific points in their sugar-phosphate backbones&#160;(Figure 11.1). Each restriction endonuclease recognises a specific </span><span class="char-style-override-6">palindromic nucleotide sequences</span><span> in the DNA. </span><span></span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>D</span><span>o you</span><span> know what palindromes are?  These are groups of letters that form the same words when read both forward and backward, e.g., “MALAYALAM”. As against a word-palindrome where the same word is read in both directions, the palindrome in DNA is a sequence of base pairs that reads same on the two strands when orientation of reading is kept the same. For exampl</span><span>e, the following sequences reads the same on </span><span>the two strands in</span><span> 5</span><span class="char-style-override-7">’→</span><span>3</span><span class="char-style-override-7">’</span><span> </span><span>direction. This is also true if rea</span><span>d in the 3</span><span class="char-style-override-7">’→</span><span>5</span><span class="char-style-override-7">’</span><span> </span><span>direction.</span><span></span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">Restriction enzymes cut the strand of DNA a little away from the centre of the palindrome sites, but between the same two bases on the opposite strands. This leaves single stranded portions at the ends. There are overhanging stretches called sticky ends on each strand (Figure 11.1). These are named so because they form hydrogen bonds with their complementary cut counterparts. This stickiness of the ends facilitates the action of the enzyme DNA ligase.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">Restriction endonucleases are used in genetic engineering to form ‘recombinant’ molecules of DNA, which are composed of DNA from  different sources/genomes.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">When cut by the same restriction enzyme, the resultant DNA fragments  have the same kind of ‘sticky-ends’ and, these can be joined together (end-to-end) using DNA ligases (Figure 11.2).</p>

These fragments can be separated by a technique known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">gel electrophoresis</span><span>. Since DNA fragments are negatively charged molecules they can be separated by forcing them to move towards the anode under an electric field through a medium/matrix. Nowadays the most commonly used matrix is agarose which is a natural polymer extracted from sea weeds.  The DNA fragments separate (resolve) according to their size through sieving effect provided by the agarose gel. Hence, the smaller the fragment size, the farther it moves. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Look at the Figure 11.3 and guess at which end of the gel the sample was loaded.</span><span> </span></p>

</div>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12">The separated DNA fragments can be visualised only after staining the DNA with a compound known as ethidium bromide followed by exposure to UV radiation (you cannot see pure DNA fragments in the visible light and without staining). You can see bright orange coloured bands of DNA in a ethidium bromide stained gel exposed to UV light (Figure 11.3). The separated bands of DNA are cut out from the agarose gel and extracted from the gel piece. This step is known as elution. The DNA fragments purified in this way are used in constructing recombinant DNA by joining them with cloning vectors.</p>
			<h3 class="Chapter-text--subheading-70blac" id="sigil_toc_id_7">11.2.2 Cloning Vectors </h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>You know that plasmids and bacteriophages have the ability to replicate within bacterial cells independent of the control of chromosomal DNA. Bacteriophages because of their high number per cell, have very high copy numbers of their genome within the bacterial cells. Some plasmids </span><span>may have only one or two copies per cell whereas others may have 15-</span><span>100 copies per cell. Their numbers can go even higher. If we are able to link an alien piece of DNA with bacteriophage or plasmid DNA, we can multiply its numbers equal to the copy number of the plasmid or bacteriophage. Vectors used at present, are engineered in such a way that they help easy linking of foreign DNA and selection of recombinants from non-recombinants.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">The following are the features that are required to facilitate cloning into a vector.</p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-16"><span>	(i)</span><span class="char-style-override-6">	</span><span class="char-style-override-10">Origin of replication (ori)</span><span class="char-style-override-7"> :</span><span> This is a sequence from where replication starts and any pi</span><span>ece of DNA when linked to this sequence ca</span><span>n be made to replicate within the host cells. This sequence is also responsible for controlling the copy number of the linked DNA. So, if one wants to recover many copies of the target DNA it should be cloned in a vector whose origin support high copy number.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-16"><span>	(ii) </span><span class="char-style-override-6">	</span><span class="char-style-override-10">Selectable marker</span><span class="char-style-override-7"> :</span><span> In addition to ‘ori’, the vector requires a selectable marker, which helps in identifying and eliminating non-transformants and selectively permitting the growth of the transformants.  </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Transformation</span><span> is a procedure through which a piece of DNA is introduced in a host bacterium (you will study the process in subsequent section). Normally, the genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline or kanamycin, etc., are considered useful selectable markers for </span><span class="char-style-override-7">E. coli.</span><span> The normal </span><span class="char-style-override-7">E. coli</span><span> cells do not carry resistance against any of these antibiotics.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-16"><span>	(iii)</span><span class="char-style-override-6">	</span><span class="char-style-override-10">Cloning sites:</span><span> In order to link the alien DNA, the vector needs to have very few, preferably single, </span><span class="char-style-override-6">recognition sites</span><span> for the commonly used restriction enzymes. Presence of more than one recognition sites within the vector will generate several fragments, which will complicate the gene cloning (Figure 11.4). The ligation of alien DNA is carried out at a restriction site present in one of the two </span><span class="char-style-override-6">antibiotic resistance</span><span> genes. For example, you can ligate a foreign DNA at the BamH I site of tetracycline resistance gene in the vector pBR322. The recombinant plasmids will lose tetracycline resistance due to insertion of foreign DNA but can still be selected out from non-recombinant ones by plating the transformants on tetracycline containing medium. The transformants growing on ampicillin containing medium are then transferred on a medium containing tetracycline. The recombinants will grow in ampicillin containing medium but not on that containing tetracycline. But, non- recombinants will grow on the medium containing both the antibiotics. In this case, one antibiotic resistance gene helps in selecting the transformants, whereas the other antibiotic resistance gene gets ‘inactivated due to insertion’ of alien DNA, and helps in selection of recombinants.</span></p>

</div>
			<p class="Chapter-running-numbering para-style-override-16"><span>		Selection of recombinants due to inactivation of antibiotics is a cumbersome procedure because it requires simultaneous plating on two plates having different</span><span> antibiotics. Therefore, </span><span>alternative selectable markers have been developed which differentiate recombinants from non-recombinants on the basis of their ability to produce colour in the presence of a chromogenic substrate. In this, a recombinant DNA is inserted within the coding sequence of an enzyme, </span><span class="char-style-override-13">β</span><span>-galactosidase.  This results into inactivation of the gene for synthesis of this enzyme, which is referred to as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">insertional inactivation</span><span>. The presence of a chromogenic substrate gives blue coloured colonies if the plasmid in the bacteria does not have an insert. Presence of insert results into insertional inactivation of the </span><span class="char-style-override-13">β</span><span>-galactosidase gene and the colonies do not produce any colour, these are identified as recombinant colonies.</span></p>

For example, </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Agrobacterium tumifaciens</span><span>, a pathogen of several dicot plants is able to deliver a piece of DNA known as </span><span>‘</span><span>T-DNA’ to transform normal plant cells into a </span><span class="char-style-override-6">tumor</span><span> and direct these tumor cells to produce the chemicals required by the pathogen. Similarly, retroviruses in animals have the ability to transform normal cells into </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cancerous</span><span> cells. A better understanding of the art of delivering genes by pathogens in their eukaryotic hosts has generated knowledge to transform these tools of pathogens into useful vectors for delivering genes of interest to humans. The tumor inducing (Ti) plasmid of </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Agrobacterium tumifaciens</span><span> has now been modified into a cloning vector which is no more pathogenic to the plants but is still able to use the mechanisms to deliver genes of our interest into a variety of plants. Similarly, retroviruses have also been disarmed and are now used to deliver desirable genes into animal cells. So, once a gene or a DNA fragment has been ligated into a suitable vector it is transferred into a bacterial, plant or animal host (where it multiplies).</span><span class="char-style-override-6"></span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>Since DNA is a hydrophilic molecule, it cannot pass through cell membranes. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Wh</span><span class="char-style-override-7">y</span><span>? In order to force bacteria to take up the plasmid, the bacterial cells must first be made ‘competent’ to take up DNA. This is done by treating them with a specific concentration of a divalent cation, such as calcium, which increases the efficiency with which DNA enters the bacterium through pores in its cell wall. Recombinant DNA can then be forced into such cells by incubating the cells with recombinant DNA on ice, followed by placing them briefly at 42</span><span class="char-style-override-14">0</span><span>C (heat shock), and then putting them back on ice. This enables the bacteria to take up the recombinant DNA. </span><span></span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>This is not the only way to introduce alien DNA into host cells. In a method known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">micro-injection</span><span>, recombinant DNA is directly injected into the nucleus of an animal cell. In another method, suitable for plants, cells are bombarded with high velocity micro-particles of gold or tungsten coated with DNA in a method known as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">biolistics</span><span> or </span><span class="char-style-override-6">gene gun</span><span>. And the last method uses ‘disarmed pathogen’ vectors, which when allowed to infect the cell, transfer the recombinant DNA into the host.</span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>Now that we have learnt about the tools for constructing recombinant DNA, let us discuss the processes facilitating recombinant DNA technology.</span><span></span></p>
			<h2 class="Chapter-text-heading para-style-override-15" id="sigil_toc_id_9"><span class="char-style-override-8">11.3 Processes of Recombinant DNA Technology</span><span></span></h2>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>Recombinant DNA technology involves several steps in specific sequence such as isolation of DNA, fragmentation of DNA by restriction endonucleases, isolation of a desired DNA fragment, ligation of the DNA fragment into a vector, transferring the recombinant DNA into the host, culturing the host cells in a medium at large scale and extraction of the desired product. Let us examine each of these steps in some details.</span><span></span></p>
			<h3 class="Chapter-text--subheading-70blac" id="sigil_toc_id_10">11.3.1 Isolation of the Genetic Material (DNA)</h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>Recall that nucleic acid is the genetic material of all organisms without exception. In majority of organisms this is deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA. In order to cut the DNA with restriction enzymes, it needs to be in pure form, free from other macro-molecules. Since the DNA is enclosed within the membranes, we have to break the cell open to release DNA along with other macromolecules such as RNA, proteins, polysaccharides and also lipids. This can be achieved by treating the bacterial cells/plant or animal tissue with enzymes such as </span><span class="char-style-override-6">lysozyme</span><span> (bacteria), </span><span class="char-style-override-6">cellulase </span><span>(plant cells), </span><span class="char-style-override-6">chitinase</span><span> (fungus). You know that genes are located on long molecules of DNA interwined with proteins such as histones. The RNA can be removed by treatment with ribonuclease whereas proteins can be removed by treatment with protease. Other molecules can be removed by appropriate treatments and purified DNA ultimately precipitates out after the addition of chilled ethanol. This can be seen as collection of fine threads in the suspension (Figure 11.5).</span><span></span></p>

			<h3 class="Chapter-text--subheading-70blac" id="sigil_toc_id_11"><span>11.</span><span>3.2 Cutti</span><span>ng of DNA at Specific Locations</span></h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>Restrictio</span><span>n enzyme digestions are performed by incubating purified DNA molecules with the restriction enzyme, at the optimal conditions for that specific enzyme. Agarose gel electrophoresis is employed to check the progression of a restriction enzyme digestion. DNA is a negatively charged molecule, hence it moves towards the positive electrode (anode) (Figure 11.3).  The process is repeated with the vector DNA also. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">The joining of DNA involves several processes. After having cut the source DNA as well as the vector DNA with a specific restriction enzyme, the cut out ‘gene of interest’ from the source DNA and the cut vector with space are mixed and ligase is added. This results in the preparation of recombinant DNA.</p>
			<h3 class="Chapter-text--subheading-70blac" id="sigil_toc_id_12">11.3.3 Amplification of Gene of Interest using PCR </h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>PCR stands for </span><span class="char-style-override-6">Polymerase Chain Reaction</span><span>.</span><span class="char-style-override-6"> </span><span>In this reaction, multiple copies of the gene (or DNA) of interest is synthesised </span><span class="char-style-override-7">in vitro</span><span> using two sets of primers (small chemically synthesised oligonucleotides that are complementary to the regions of DNA) and the enzyme DNA polymerase. The enzyme extends the primers using the nucleotides provided in the reaction and the genomic DNA as template. If the process of replication of DNA is repeated many times, the segment of DNA can be amplified to approximately billion times, i.e., 1 billion copies are made.  Such repeated amplification is achieved by the use of a thermostable DNA polymerase (isolated from a bacterium, </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Thermus aquaticus</span><span>), which remain active during the high temperature induced denaturation of double stranded DNA.  The amplified fragment  if desired can now be used to ligate with a vector for further cloning (Figure11.6).</span></p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>There are several methods of introducing the ligated DNA into recipient cells. Recipient cells after making them ‘competent’ to receive, take up DNA present in its surrounding. So, if a recombinant DNA bearing gene for resistance to an antibiotic (e.g., ampicillin) is transferred into </span><span class="char-style-override-7"> E. coli</span><span> cells, the host cells become transformed into ampicillin-resistant cells. If we spread the transformed cells on agar plates containing ampicillin, only transformants will grow, untransformed recipient cells will die. Since, due to ampicillin resistance gene, one is able to select a transformed cell in the presence of ampicillin. The ampicillin resistance gene in this case is called a </span><span class="char-style-override-6">selectable marker</span><span>.  </span></p>
			<h3 class="Chapter-text--subheading-70blac" id="sigil_toc_id_14">11.3.5 Obtaining the Foreign Gene Product </h3>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-12"><span>When you insert a piece of alien DNA into a cloning vector and transfer it into a bacterial, plant or animal cell, the alien DNA</span><span> gets multiplied. In almost all recombinant technologies, the ultimate aim is to produce a desirable protein. Hence, the</span><span>re is a need for the recombinant DNA to be expressed. The foreign gene gets expressed under appropriate conditions. The expression of foreign genes in host cells involve understanding many technical details. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>After having cloned the gene of interest and having optimised the conditions to induce the expression of the target protein, one has to consider producing it on a large scale. </span><span class="char-style-override-7">Can you think of any reason why there is a need for large-scale production</span><span>? If any protein encoding gene is expressed in a heterologous host, it is called a </span><span class="char-style-override-6">recombinant protein</span><span>. The cells harbouring cloned genes of interest may be grown on a small scale in the laboratory. The cultures may be used for extracting the desired protein and then purifying it by using different separation techniques. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>The cells can also be multiplied in a continuous culture system wherein the used medium is drained out from one side while fresh medium is added from the other to maintain the cells in their physiologically most active log/exponential phase. This type of culturing method produces a larger biomass leading to  higher yields of desired </span><span>protein. </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14"><span>Small volume cultures cannot yield appreciable quantities of products. To produce in large quantities, the development of </span><span class="char-style-override-6">bioreactors</span><span>, where large volumes (100-1000 litres) of culture can be processed, was required. Thus, bioreactors can be thought of as vessels in which raw materials are biologically converted into specific products,  individual enzymes, etc., using microbial plant, animal or human cells. A bioreactor provides the optimal conditions for achieving the desired product by providing optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, substrate, salts, vitamins, oxygen). </span></p>
			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">The most commonly used bioreactors are of stirring type, which are shown in Figure 11.7. </p>

			<p class="Chapter-running-text para-style-override-14">A stirred-tank reactor is usually cylindrical or with a curved base to facilitate the mixing of the reactor contents. The stirrer facilitates even mixing and oxygen availability throughout the bioreactor. Alternatively air can be bubbled through the reactor. If you look at the figure closely you will see that the bioreactor has an agitator system, an oxygen delivery system and a foam control system, a temperature control system, pH control system and sampling ports so that small volumes of the culture can be withdrawn periodically.</p>

The processes include separation and purification, which are collectively referred to as downstream processing.  The product has to be formulated with suitable preservatives.  Such formulation has to undergo thorough clinical trials as in case of drugs.  Strict quality control testing for each product is also required.

			<p class="Summary-Text para-style-override-30"><span class="char-style-override-19">Biotechnology deals with large scale production and marketing of products and processes using live organisms, cells or enzymes. Modern biotechnology using genetically modified organisms was made possible only when man learnt to alter the chemistry of DNA and construct recombinant DNA. This key process is called recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering. This process involves the use of restriction endonucleases, DNA ligase, appropriate plasmid or viral vectors to isolate and ferry the foreign DNA into host organisms, expression of the foreign gene, purification of the gene product, i.e., the functional protein and finally making a suitable formulation for marketing. Large scale production involves use of bioreactors.</span></p>
