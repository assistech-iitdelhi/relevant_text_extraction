			<div class="Heading">1.1  Introduction<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">&#160;</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-2">All of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when we take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather. This is almost inevitable with ladies garments like a polyester saree. Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another common example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the sky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric shock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a bus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is discharge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated due to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that this is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we are going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything that does not move or change with time. </span><span class="char-style-override-3">Electrostatics deals with the study of forces, fields and potentials arising from static charges</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. </span><span class="char-style-override-2"></span></div>
			<div class="Heading">1.2  Electric Charge</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-2">Historically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with wool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece, around 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word </span><span class="char-style-override-3">elektron</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> meaning </span><span class="char-style-override-3">amber</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. Many such pairs of materials were known which</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> on rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of papers. You can perform the following activity at home to experience such an effect. Cut out long thin strips of white paper and lightly iron them. Take them near a TV screen or computer monitor. You will see that the strips get attracted to the screen. In fact they remain stuck to the screen for a while. </span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-4">It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth are brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The two strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were rubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted each other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each other [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic rod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with which the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur. </div>

<div><div class="Normal para-style-override-10" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="char-style-override-7">Figure</span><span class="char-style-override-8">&#160;1.1</span></span><span class="char-style-override-9">&#160;Rods and pith balls: like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other.</span></div>
</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">If a plastic rod rubbed with fur is made to touch two small pith balls (now-a-days we can use polystyrene balls) suspended by silk or nylon thread, then the balls repel each other [Fig. 1.1(d)] and are also repelled by the rod. A similar effect is found if the pith balls are touched with a glass rod rubbed with silk [Fig. 1.1(e)]. A dramatic observation is that a pith ball touched with glass rod attracts another pith ball touched with plastic rod [Fig. 1.1(</span><span class="char-style-override-2">f</span><span class="char-style-override-2">)].</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts and careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many careful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of an entity which is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-3">electric charge</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. We say that the bodies like glass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire an electric charge on rubbing. The experiments on pith balls suggested that there are two kinds of electrification and we find  that (i) </span><span class="char-style-override-3">like charges repel</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> and (ii) </span><span class="char-style-override-3">unlike charges</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span class="char-style-override-3">attract</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> each other. The experiments also demonstrated that the charges are transferred from the rods to the pith balls on  contact. It is said that the pith balls are electrified or are charged by  contact. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-3">polarity</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> of charge.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of charge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for any pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified glass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they no longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light objects as they did on being electrified.</span><span class="char-style-override-2"></span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged bodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these observations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects neutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named as </span><span class="char-style-override-3">positive</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> and </span><span class="char-style-override-3">negative</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin. We know that when we add a positive number to a negative number of the same magnitude, the sum is zero. This might have been the philosophy in naming the charges as positive and negative. By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and that on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an electric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge it is said to be electrically neutral.</span></div>
<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">A simple apparatus to detect charge</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> on a body is the </span><span class="char-style-override-3">gold-leaf electroscope </span><span class="char-style-override-5">[Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a box, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged object touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to the leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of the amount of charge. </span></div>

				<div class="Normal para-style-override-6" style="text-align: center;"><span class="char-style-override-6" style="font-weight: bold;">Unification of electricity and magnetism</span></div>
<div class="Normal para-style-override-6"><span class="char-style-override-2">In olden days, electricity and magnetism were treated as separate subjects. Electricity dealt with charges on glass rods, cat’s fur, batteries, lightning, etc., while magnetism described interactions of magnets, iron filings, compass needles, etc. In 1820 Danish scientist Oersted found that a compass needle is deflected by passing an electric current through a wire placed near the needle. Ampere and Faraday supported this observation by saying that electric charges in motion produce magnetic fields and moving magnets generate electricity. The unification was achieved when the Scottish physicist Maxwell and the Dutch physicist Lorentz put forward a theory where they showed the interdependence of these two subjects. This field is called </span><span class="char-style-override-3">electromagnetism</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. Most of the phenomena occurring around us can be described under electromagnetism. Virtually every force that we can think of like friction, chemical force between atoms holding the matter together, and even the forces describing processes occurring in cells of living organisms, have its origin in electromagnetic force. Electromagnetic force is one of the fundamental forces of nature.</span></div>
				<div class="Normal para-style-override-9">Maxwell put forth four equations that play the same role in classical electromagnetism as Newton’s equations of motion and gravitation law play in mechanics. He also argued that light is electromagnetic in nature and its speed can be found by making purely electric and magnetic measurements. He claimed that the science of optics is intimately related to that of electricity and magnetism.</div>
				<div class="Normal para-style-override-9">The science of electricity and magnetism is the foundation for the modern technological civilisation. Electric power, telecommunication, radio and television, and a wide variety of the practical appliances used in daily life are based on the principles of this science. Although charged particles in motion exert both electric and magnetic forces, in the frame of reference where all the charges are at rest, the forces are purely electrical. You know that gravitational force is a long-range force. Its effect is felt even when the distance between the interacting particles is very large because the force decreases inversely as the square of the distance between the interacting bodies. We will learn in this chapter that electric force is also as pervasive and is in fact stronger than the gravitational force by several orders of magnitude (refer to Chapter 1 of Class XI Physics Textbook).</div>

<div class="Normal para-style-override-4">Students can make a simple electroscope as follows [Fig. 1.2(b)]: Take a thin aluminium curtain rod with ball ends fitted for hanging the curtain. Cut out a piece of length about 20 cm with the ball at one end and flatten the cut end. Take a large bottle that can hold this rod and a cork which will fit in the opening of the bottle. Make a hole in the cork sufficient to hold the curtain rod snugly. Slide the rod through the hole in the cork with the cut end on the lower side and ball end projecting above the cork. Fold a small, thin aluminium foil (about 6 cm in length) in the middle and attach it to the flattened end of the rod by cellulose tape. This forms the leaves of your electroscope. Fit the cork in the bottle with about 5 cm of the ball end projecting above the cork. A paper scale may be put inside the bottle in advance to measure the separation of leaves. The separation is a rough measure of the amount of charge on the electroscope.</div>

</div>
</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">To understand how the electroscope works, use the white paper strips we used for seeing the attraction of charged bodies. Fold the strips into half so that you make a mark of fold. Open the strip and iron it lightly with the mountain fold up, as shown in Fig. 1.3. Hold the strip by pinching it at the fold. You would notice that the two halves move apart. </span><span class="char-style-override-2">This shows that the strip has acquired charge on ironing. When you fold it into half, both the halves have the same charge. Hence they repel each other. The same effect is seen in the leaf electroscope. On charging the curtain rod by touching the ball end with an electrified body, charge is transferred to the curtain rod and the attached aluminium foil. Both the halves of the foil get similar charge and therefore repel each other. The divergence in the leaves depends on the amount of charge on them. Let us first try to understand why material bodies acquire charge.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-5">You know that all matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the materials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges are exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that hold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated with surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the forces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and it encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is therefore  essential that we learn more about such a force.</span></div>

<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of charge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this excess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being  less tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred from one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by losing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> by gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the electrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets positively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is created in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are transferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the material body. Also only the less tightly bound electrons in a material body can be transferred from it to another by rubbing. Therefore, when a body is rubbed with another, the bodies get charged and that is why we have to stick to certain pairs of materials to notice charging on rubbing the bodies. </span></div>

			<div class="Heading">1.3  Conductors and Insulators</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-11">A metal rod held in hand and rubbed with wool will not show any sign of being charged. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic handle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows signs of charging. Suppose we connect one end of a copper wire to a neutral pith ball and the other end to a negatively charged plastic rod. We will find that the pith ball acquires a negative charge. If a similar experiment is repeated with a nylon thread or a rubber band, no transfer of charge will take place from the plastic rod to the pith ball. Why does the transfer of charge not take place from the rod to the ball? </div>
<div class="Normal para-style-override-11"><br/></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">Some substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others do not. </span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span class="char-style-override-2">Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are called </span><span class="char-style-override-3">conductors</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. They have electric charges (electrons) that are comparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal bodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass, porcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of electricity through them. They are called </span><span class="char-style-override-3">insulators</span><span class="char-style-override-2">.</span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span><span class="char-style-override-2">Most  substances fall into one of the two classes stated above</span><span class="char-style-override-10">*</span><span class="char-style-override-2">.</span></div>
<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2"><br/></span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-4">When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets distributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some charge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn why this happens in the next chapter.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-4">This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb gets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article like spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through our body to the ground as both are conductors of electricity.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">  When we bring a charged body  in contact with the earth,  all the excess charge on the body disappears by causing a momentary current to pass to the ground through the connecting conductor (such as our body). This process of sharing the charges with the earth is called </span><span class="char-style-override-3">grounding or earthing</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. Earthing provides a safety measure for electrical circuits and appliances. A thick metal plate is buried deep into the earth and thick wires are drawn from this plate; these are  used in buildings  for the purpose of earthing near the mains supply.  The electric wiring in our houses has three wires: live, neutral and earth. The first two carry</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> electric current from the power station and the third is earthed by connecting it to the buried metal plate. Metallic bodies of the electric appliances such as electric iron, refrigerator, TV are connected to the earth wire. When any fault occurs or live wire touches the metallic body, the charge flows to the earth without damaging the appliance and without causing any injury to the humans; this  would have otherwise been unavoidable since  the human body is a  conductor of electricity.</span></div>

			<div class="Heading">1.4  Charging by Induction</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-2">When we touch a pith ball with an electrified plastic rod, some of the negative charges on the rod are transferred to the pith ball and it also gets charged. Thus the pith ball is </span><span class="char-style-override-3">charged by contact</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. It is then repelled by the plastic rod but is attracted by a glass rod which is oppositely charged. However, why a electrified rod attracts light objects, is  a  question we have still left unanswered. Let us try to understand what could be happening by performing the following experiment.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-12"><span class="char-style-override-2">(</span><span class="char-style-override-2">i)	Bring two metal spheres, A and B, supported on insulating stands, in contact as shown in Fig. 1.4(a). </span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-12"><span class="char-style-override-2">(ii)	Bring a positively charged rod near one of the spheres, say A, taking care that it does not touch the sphere. The free electrons in the spheres are attracted towards the rod. This leaves an excess of positive charge on the rear surface of sphere B. Both kinds of charges are bound in the metal spheres and cannot escape. They, therefore, reside on the surfaces, as shown in Fig. 1.4(b). The left surface of sphere A, has an excess of negative charge and the right surface of sphere B, has an excess of positive charge. However, not all of the electrons in the spheres have accumulated on the left surface of A. As the negative charge starts building up at the left surface of A, other electrons are repelled by these. In a short time, equilibrium is reached under the action of force of attraction of the rod and the force of repulsion due to the accumulated charges. Fig. 1.4(b) shows the equilibrium situation. The process is called </span><span class="char-style-override-3">induction of charge</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> and happens almost instantly. The accumulated charges remain on the surface, as shown, till the glass rod is held near the sphere. If the rod is removed, the charges are not acted by any outside force and they redistribute to their original neutral state.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-13">(iii)	Separate the spheres by a small distance while the glass rod is still held near sphere A, as shown in Fig. 1.4(c). The two spheres are found to be oppositely charged and attract each other. </div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-13">(iv)	Remove the rod. The charges on spheres rearrange themselves as shown in Fig. 1.4(d). Now, separate the spheres quite apart. The charges on them get uniformly distributed over them, as shown in <br/>Fig. 1.4(e). </div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">In this process, the metal spheres will each be equal and oppositely charged. This is </span><span class="char-style-override-3">charging by induction</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. The positively charged glass rod does not lose any of its charge, contrary to the process of charging by contact.</span><span class="char-style-override-2"></span></div>

			<div class="Normal para-style-override-4">When electrified rods are brought near light objects, a similar effect takes place. The rods induce opposite charges on the near surfaces of the objects and similar charges move to the farther side of the object. [This happens even when the light object is not a conductor. The mechanism for how this happens is explained later in Sections 1.10 and 2.10.] The centres of the two types of charges are slightly separated. We know that opposite charges attract while similar charges repel. However, the magnitude of force depends on the distance between the charges and in this case the force of attraction overweighs the force of repulsion. As a result the particles like bits of paper or pith balls, being light, are pulled towards the rods.   </div>

As the rod is brought close to the sphere, the free electrons in the sphere move away due to repulsion and start piling up at the farther end. The near end becomes positively charged due to deficit of electrons. This process of charge distribution stops when the net force on the free electrons inside the metal is zero. Connect the sphere to the ground by a conducting wire. The electrons will flow to the ground while the positive charges at the near end will remain held there due to the attractive force of the negative charges on the rod, as shown in Fig. 1.5(c). Disconnect the sphere from the ground. The positive charge continues to be <br/>held at the near end [Fig. 1.5(d)]. Remove the electrified rod.

Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to interactions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is found that </span><span class="char-style-override-3">the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved</span><span class="char-style-override-2">.

When the separation between two spheres is much larger than the radius of each sphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.

Coulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the charge on a metallic sphere is </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. If the sphere is put in contact with an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over the two spheres.

He thus arrived in 1785 at the inverse square law relation, now known as Coulomb’s law.

			<div class="subHeading"></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-11">You may wonder why the notion of electric field has been introduced here at all. After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity is the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this intermediate quantity called the electric field?</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not really necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the electrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in the space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive test charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing the system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and is independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine the field. The term </span><span class="char-style-override-3">field</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> in physics generally refers to a quantity that is defined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric field is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-5"><span class="char-style-override-2">The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however, emerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-dependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force between two distant charges </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">1</span><span class="char-style-override-2">, </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">2</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> in accelerated motion. Now the greatest speed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another is </span><span class="char-style-override-3">c</span><span class="char-style-override-2">, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">1</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> on </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">2</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> cannot</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> arise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect (force on </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">2</span><span class="char-style-override-2">) and the cause (motion of </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">1</span><span class="char-style-override-2">). It is precisely here that the notion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very useful. </span><span class="char-style-override-3">The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">1</span><span class="char-style-override-3"> produces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed c, reach q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">2</span><span class="char-style-override-3"> and cause a force on q</span><span class="char-style-override-16">2</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. The notion of field elegantly accounts for the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be detected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as physical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an </span><span class="char-style-override-3">independent dynamics </span><span class="char-style-override-2">of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws of their </span><span class="char-style-override-3">own</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-dependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time and then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields transporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday and is now among the central concepts in physics.</span></div>

Since the magnitude of electric field at a point decreases inversely as the square of the distance of that point from the charge, the vector gets shorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing radially outward. Figure 1.15 shows such a picture.  In this figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the force acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of that arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction and the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus get many </span><span class="char-style-override-2">field lines, all pointing outwards from the point charge. Have we lost the information about the strength or magnitude of the field now, because it was contained in the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the field is represented by the density of field lines. </span><span class="char-style-override-4">E</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> is strong near the charge, so the density of field lines is more near the charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge, the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less, resulting in well-separated lines.</span><span class="char-style-override-2"></span></div>

So if one wishes to estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the number of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular to the lines.

The field lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart where it is weak. Figure 1.16 shows a set of field lines. We can imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and S normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture cutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at these points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.</div>

			<div class="Normal para-style-override-4">The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in general, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let us note some important points regarding this law:</div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<div class="Normal para-style-override-10"><br/></div>
</div>
</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-13">(i)	Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape or size.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-12"><span class="char-style-override-2">(ii)	The term </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the sum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located anywhere inside the surface.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-12"><span class="char-style-override-2">(iii)	In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some charges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears on the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and outside </span><span class="char-style-override-3">S</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. The term </span><span class="char-style-override-3">q</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> on the right side of Gauss’s law, however, represents only the total charge inside </span><span class="char-style-override-3">S</span><span class="char-style-override-2">. </span><span class="char-style-override-2"></span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-13">(iv)	The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called the Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and apply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface pass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due to a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of any charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without any bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a continuous charge distribution.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-12"><span class="char-style-override-2">(v)	Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the electrostatic field </span><span class="char-style-override-3">when the system has some symmetry.</span><span class="char-style-override-2"> This is facilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.</span><span class="char-style-override-3"> </span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-13">(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on distance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s law will indicate departure from the inverse square law.</div>

			<div class="heading-5 para-style-override-64">1.	Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms, molecules and bulk matter.</div>
			<div class="heading-5 para-style-override-64">2.	From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is then negative. </div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-64">3.	Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-64">4.	Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity and conservation.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-65"><span class="char-style-override-56">	Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (</span><span class="char-style-override-57">q</span><span class="char-style-override-56">) of a body is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (</span><span class="char-style-override-57">e</span><span class="char-style-override-56">) i.e., </span><span class="char-style-override-57"><br/>q</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> = </span><span class="char-style-override-57">n e</span><span class="char-style-override-56">, where </span><span class="char-style-override-57">n</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, ....

For macroscopic charges for which </span><span class="char-style-override-57">n</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> is a very large number, quantisation of charge can be ignored.</span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-64">	Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs) of all individual charges in the system. </div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-64">	Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge from one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.</div>

Why do they not fly away? You will learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force, called the strong force which holds them together. The range of distance where this force is effective is, however, very small ~10</span><span class="char-style-override-62">-14</span><span class="char-style-override-59"> m. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are not allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus, due to the laws of quantum mechanics.

But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while Coulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing possibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite being a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive force in nature.<br/></div>

The constant of proportionality </span><span class="char-style-override-57">k</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> in Coulomb’s law is a matter of choice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI units, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic effect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined by (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of </span><span class="char-style-override-57">k</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> is no longer arbitrary; it is approximately 9 × 10</span><span class="char-style-override-62">9</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> N m</span><span class="char-style-override-62">2</span><span class="char-style-override-56"> C</span><span class="char-style-override-62">–2</span><span class="char-style-override-56">.</span></div>

The rather large value of </span><span class="char-style-override-57">k</span><span class="char-style-override-56">, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge (1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as mentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of magnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally much weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit of reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for electric effects. </span></div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-68">5.	The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related to the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it; charge is a scalar.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-68">6.	Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also invariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always true for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under rotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative <br/>motion.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-68">7.	Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property independent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6. Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference. A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an inelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector quantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-68">8.	Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature; interestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-68">9.	Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or equated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things: force on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the presence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body, four-body, etc., forces which arise only when there are more than two charges.</div>
			<div class="Normal para-style-override-67"><span class="char-style-override-56">10.	The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined at the locations of the discrete charges.
