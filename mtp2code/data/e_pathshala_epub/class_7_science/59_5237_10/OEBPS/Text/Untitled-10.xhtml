			<p class="x1st-para" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">In Chapter 2 you learnt that all organisms are made of small microscopic units called cells. A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Each cell of an organism performs certain functions such as nutrition, transport, excretion and reproduction. To perform these functions, the cell needs energy. Even when we are eating, sleeping or reading we require energy. But, where does this energy come from? Can you say why your parents insist that you should eat regularly? The food has stored energy, which is released during respiration. Therefore, all living organisms respire to get energy from food. During breathing, we breathe in air. You know that air contains oxygen. We breathe out air which is rich in carbon dioxide. The air we breathe in is transported to all parts of the body and ultimately to each cell. In  the cells, oxygen in the air helps in the breakdown of food. The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the release of energy is called </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">cellular respiration</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Cellular respiration takes place in the</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US"> cells of all organisms</span><span xml:lang="en-US">.</span></p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">In the cell, the food (glucose) is broken down into carbon dioxide and water using oxygen. When breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">aerobic</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">respiration</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Food can also be broken down, without using oxygen. This is called </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">anaerobic respiration</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. Breakdown of food releases energy. </span></p>

They are called </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US">anaerobes</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. They get energy through anaerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, glucose breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide, as given below: </span></p>

			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Our muscle cells can also respire anaerobically, but only for a short time, when there is a temporary deficiency of oxygen. During heavy exercise, fast running (Fig. 10.1), cycling, walking for many hours or heavy weight lifting, the demand for energy is high. But the supply of oxygen to produce the energy is limited. Then anaerobic respiration takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil the demand of energy: </p>

			<p class="Running-text"><span>Have you ever wondered why you get muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The cramps occur when muscle cells respire anaerobically. The partial breakdown of glucose produces lactic acid. The accumulation of lactic acid</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US"> </span><span xml:lang="en-US">causes muscle cramps. We get relief from cramps after a hot water bath or a massage. Can you guess why it is so? Hot water bath or massage improves circulation of blood. As a result, the supply of oxygen to the muscle cells increases. The increase in the supply of oxygen results in the complete breakdown of lactic acid into carbon dioxide and water. </span></p>

A large, muscular sheet called </span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US"><b>diaphragm</b></span> forms the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 10.4).

				<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-2">During inhalation, ribs move up and outwards and diaphragm moves down. This movement increases space in our chest cavity and air rushes into the lungs. The lungs get filled with air. During exhalation, ribs move down and inwards, while diaphragm moves up to its former position. This reduces the size of the chest cavity and air is pushed out of the lungs (Fig. 10.5). These movements in our body can be felt easily. Take a deep breath.

<li>If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen, it is called aerobic respiration. If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen, the respiration is called anaerobic respiration.</li>
<li>During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is insufficient, food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration.</li>
<li>Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an organism takes in the oxygen-rich air and gives out air rich in carbon dioxide. The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different organisms.<br/></li>
<li>During inhalation, our lungs expand and then come back to the original state as the air moves out during exhalation.</li>
