			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Animals are adapted to survive in the conditions in which they live.&#160;Animals living in very cold and hot climate must possess special features to protect themselves against the extreme cold or heat.&#160;Recall from Chapter 9 of your Class VI science book the definition of adaptation. Features and habits that help animals to adapt to their surroundings are a result of the process of evolution. </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">In Chapter 9 you will learn about the effect of weather and climate on soil. Here we will study the effect of climate on animals only. In Class VI, you have read about adaptations of animals to</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> certain habitats. As examples of adaptation of animals to climatic conditions, we discuss only animals living in polar regions and tropical rainforests. </span></p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">As the name suggests, the polar regions are situated near the poles, i.e., north pole and south pole. </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Some well-known countries that belong to the polar regions are Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Alaska in U.S.A. and Siberian region of Russia. </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Examples of some countries where the tropical rainforests are found are India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria.</p>
			<p class="Activity-Rule" xml:lang="en-GB"><b><u>Activity 7.2</u></b></p>
			<p class="activity-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Take an outline map of the world. Mark the polar regions in blue. Similarly, mark the tropical regions in red.</p>
			<h3 class="sub-head" xml:lang="en-GB">(i) The polar regions </h3>
			<p class="x1st-para" xml:lang="en-GB">The polar regions present an extreme climate. These regions are covered with snow and it is very cold for most part of the year.&#160;For six months the sun does not set at the poles while for the other six months the sun does not rise. In winters, the temperature can be as low as –37°C. Animals living there have adapted to these severe conditions.&#160;Let us see how they are adapted by considering the examples of polar bears and penguins. </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Polar bears have white fur so that they are not easily visible in the snowy white background. It protects them from their predators. It also helps them in catching their prey. To protect them from extreme cold, they have two thick layers of fur. They also have a layer of fat under their skin. In fact, they are so well-insulated that they have to move slowly and rest often to avoid getting overheated. </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Physical activities on warm days necessitate cooling.&#160;So, the polar bear goes for swimming. It is a good swimmer.&#160;Its paws are wide and large, which help it not only to swim well but also walk with ease in the snow.&#160;While swimming under water, it can close its nostrils and can remain under water for long durations.&#160;It has a strong sense of smell so that it can catch its prey <br/>for food. We can understand the adaptations of polar bears with the help of the flow chart shown in Fig. 7.3.</p>

<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Another well-known animal living in the polar regions is the penguin <br/>(Fig. 7.4).&#160;It is also white and merges well with the white background.&#160;It also has a thick skin and a lot of fat to protect it from cold. You may have seen pictures of penguins huddled together.&#160;This they do to keep warm.&#160;Recall how warm you feel when you are in a hall full of people. Like polar bears, penguins are also good swimmers.&#160;Their bodies are streamlined and their feet have webs, making them good swimmers (Fig. 7.5). </p>

<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Other animals living in the polar regions are many types of fishes, musk oxen, reindeers, foxes, seals, whales, and birds.&#160;&#160;It is to be noted that while fish can remain under cold water for long, birds must remain warm to survive.&#160;They migrate to warmer regions when winter sets in.&#160;They come back after the winter is over. You know probably that India is one of the destinations of many of these birds. You must have seen or heard about the Siberian crane that comes from Siberia to places like Bharatpur in Rajasthan and Sultanpur in Haryana, and some wetlands of north east and some other parts of India (Fig. 7.6).&#160;</p>

But how these birds travel to the same place year after year is still a mystery. It seems that these birds have a built–in sense of direction and know in which direction to travel. Some birds probably use landmarks to guide them. Many birds may be guided by the sun during the day and stars at night. There is some evidence that birds may use the magnetic field of the earth to find direction. And it is not only birds that migrate; mammals, many types of fish and insects are also known to migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates.­</div>

<h3 class="sub-head" xml:lang="en-GB">(ii) The tropical rainforests<br/></h3>
			<p class="x1st-para" xml:lang="en-GB">The tropical region has generally a hot climate because of its location around the equator. Even in the coldest month the temperature is generally higher than about 15°C.&#160;During hot summers, the temperature may cross 40°C. Days and nights are almost equal in length throughout the year.&#160;These regions get plenty of rainfall. An important feature of this region is the tropical rainforests. Tropical rainforests are found in Western Ghats and Assam in India, Southeast Asia, Central America and Central Africa. Because of continuous warmth and rain, this region supports wide variety of plants and animals.&#160;The major types of animals living in the rainforests are monkeys, apes, gorillas, tigers, elephants, leopards, lizards, snakes, birds and insects.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Let us read about the adaptations of these animals to a hot, humid climate. </p>
			<div>
				<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame">
					<p class="Figure-No-" xml:lang="en-GB">The climatic conditions in rainforests are highly suitable for supporting an enormous number and a variety of animals.<br/></p>
</div>
</div>
			<div>
				<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame">
					<p class="Figure-No-" xml:lang="en-GB">Since the numbers are large, there is intense competition for food and shelter.&#160;Many animals are adapted to living on the trees. Red-eyed frog (Fig. 7.7) has developed sticky pads on its feet to help it climb trees on which it lives. To help them live on the trees, monkeys (Fig. 7.8) have long tails for  grasping branches. Their hands and feet are such that they can easily hold on to the branches.</p>

<p class="Running-text">As there is competition for food, some animals are adapted to get food not easily reachable. A striking example is that of the bird Toucan (Fig. 7.9), which possesses a long, large beak.&#160;This helps a toucan to reach the fruits on branches which are otherwise too weak to support its weight.&#160;&#160;&#160; </p>

					<p class="bubble" xml:lang="en-GB">Many tropical animals have sensitive hearing, sharp eyesight, thick skin and a skin colour which helps them to camouflage by blending with the surroundings. This is to protect them from predators. For example, big cats (lions and tigers) have thick skins and sensitive hearing. &#160;&#160;<br/><span xml:lang="en-US">The lion-tailed macaque</span><span class="char-style-override-3" xml:lang="en-US"> </span>(also called Beard ape) lives in the rainforests of Western Ghats (Fig. 7.10). Its most outstanding feature is the silver-white mane, which surrounds the head from the cheeks down to its chin. It is a good climber and spends a major part of its life on the tree. It feeds mainly on fruits. It also eats seeds, young leaves, stems, flowers and buds. This beard ape also searches for insects under the bark of the trees. Since it is able to get sufficient food on the trees, it rarely comes down on the ground.</p>

					<p class="Figure-No-" xml:lang="en-GB">Another well-known animal of Indian tropical rainforest is the elephant (Fig. 7.11). It has adapted to the conditions of rainforests in many remarkable ways. Look at its trunk. It uses it as a nose because of which it has a strong sense of smell. The trunk is also used by it for picking up food. Moreover, its tusks are modified teeth. These can tear the bark of trees that elephant loves to eat. So, the elephant is able to handle the competition for food rather well. Large ears of the elephant help it to hear even very soft sounds. They also help the elephant to keep cool in the hot and humid climate of the rainforest.</p>

<li>The day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to the temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind-speed, etc., is called the weather at that place.</li>
<li></li>
<li>The weather is generally not the same on any two days and week after week.</li>
<li></li>
<li>The maximum temperature of the day occurs generally in the afternoon while the minimum temperature occurs in the early morning.</li>
<li>The times of sunrise and sunset also change during the year.<br/></li>
<li>All the changes in the weather are driven by the sun.<br/></li>
<li></li>
<li>The average weather pattern taken over a long time, say 25 years, is called the climate of the place.</li>
<li>The tropical and the polar regions are the two regions of the earth, which have severe climatic conditions.<br/></li>
<li>Animals are adapted to the conditions in which they live.<br/></li>
<li>The polar regions are very cold throughout the year. The sun does not set for six months in a year and in the other six months it does not rise.<br/></li>
<li></li>
<li>Animals in the polar region are adapted to the extremely cold climate by having some special characteristics such as white fur, strong sense of smell, a layer of fat under the skin, wide and large paws for swimming and walking, etc.</li>
<li>Migration is another means to escape the harsh, cold conditions.<br/></li>
<li></li>
<li>Because of the hospitable climatic conditions huge populations of plants and animals are found in the tropical rainforests.</li>
<li>Animals in the tropical rainforests are adapted such that they eat different kinds of food to overcome the competition for food and shelter.</li>
<li>Some adaptations of animals living in the tropical rainforests include living on the trees, development of strong tails, long and large beaks, bright colours, sharp patterns, loud voice, diet of fruits, sensitive hearing, sharp eyesight, thick skin, ability to camouflage in order to protect themselves from predators, etc.<br/></li>
