Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in the university. The children started playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a bench in the corner. He was tired as he had participated in the golden jubilee celebrations of the town. After a while, the children also came and sat around him. They wanted to know about the celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that after the cultural programme, the senior people discussed the town’s unemployment problem. A plan was proposed to put up a factory by clearing an area of the forest just outside the town. This would give the increasing population of the town a chance to get jobs. The children were very surprised when Prof Ahmad told them that many people had objected to this idea. </span></p>

Prof Ahmad realised that the children had not visited a forest. The children also wanted to know more about the forest, so they decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad. </p>
			<h4 class="Main-Head" xml:lang="en-GB">17.1 Visit to a Forest</h4>
			<p class="x1st-para" xml:lang="en-GB">One Sunday morning, the children packed a few things like a knife, a hand lens, a stick, a notebook and walked together through a forest trail near a village. On their way, they met Tibu, a young boy of their age group, of nearby village, who was taking cattle for grazing along with his aunt. He was very agile, running here and there to keep the herd together. When he saw the children, Tibu also started walking along with them, while his aunt went on a different path. As soon as they entered the forest Tibu raised his hand and signalled them to keep quiet because noise could disturb the animals living in the forest.  </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Tibu then took them to a place at a height to show them the broad view of the forest. Children were surprised because they could not see any land <br/>(Fig. 17.1). The different treetops had </span><span xml:lang="en-US">formed green cover over the land.</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> However, the cover was not uniformly green. The environment was peaceful and a cool breeze was blowing. This made children quite fresh and happy. </span></p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">While coming down, they got excited on hearing a sudden sound of birds and some noise from the top branches of the trees. Tibu told them to relax since it was a normal phenomenon here. Because of the children’s presence, some monkeys had climbed higher up on the trees where they disturbed the birds. Animals often give this type of warning call to alert other animals. Tibu also told that many other animals like boar, bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live in the deeper areas of the forest (Fig. 17.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned children that they should not go deep into the forest.</p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Boojho and Paheli remembered that they have studied about forests as an example of a habitat in Class VI (Fig. 17.3). They could see now how the forest provides a home for many animals and plants. </p>

All animals, whether herbivores or carnivores, depend ultimately on plants for food. Organisms which feed on plants often get eaten by other organisms, and so on. For example, grass is eaten by insects, which in turn, is taken by the frog. The frog is consumed by snakes. This is said to form a food chain: <br/>Gras</span><span xml:lang="en-US">s</span><span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">→</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> insects</span><span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">→</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> frog</span><span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">→</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> snake</span><span class="char-style-override-7" xml:lang="en-US">→</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> eagle. Many food chains can be found in the forest. All food chains are linked. If any one food chain is disturbed, it affects other food chains. Every part of the forest is dependent on the other parts. If we remove one component, say trees, all other components would be affected.”</span></p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">Prof Ahmad asked children to pick up leaves from the forest floor and observe them under a hand lens.

These micro-organisms play an important role in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some dead leaves and discovered under them a layer of humus on forest floor.  The presence of humus ensures that the nutrients of the dead plants and animals are released into the soil. From there, these nutrients are again absorbed by the roots of the living plants. “What happens if an animal dies in the forest?” Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead animals become food for vultures, crows, jackals and insects.” In this way, the nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes waste in a forest (Fig. 17.9).</span><br/></p>

Prof Ahmad explained that plants release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. The plants help to provide oxygen for animal respiration.

			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Tibu told them that the forest is not just home to plants and animals. Many people also live in the forest. Some of them may belong to different tribes.

			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">It was about afternoon and the children wanted to go back. Tibu suggested another route for going back. While they were going back, it started raining. However, surprisingly, they saw that the raindrops were not hitting the forest floor directly. The uppermost layer of the forest canopy intercepted the flow of raindrops, and most of the water was coming down through the branches and the stems of the trees. From the leaves it </span><span xml:lang="en-US">was dripping slowly over branches of the shrubs and herbs (Fig. 17.13). They found that the ground was still dry. After about half an hour, the rain stopped. They noticed that the layer of dead leaves over the forest floor appeared wet now. But water did not stagnate in the forest. </span></p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">Boojho thought that if it had rained so heavily in his town, it would have flooded the drains and roads.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">What would happen if it rains heavily in your town?</p>

				<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame">
					<p class="Figure-No-" xml:lang="en-GB">Prof Ahmad told them that the forest also acts as a natural absorber of rainwater and allows it to seep. It helps maintain the water table throughout the year. Forests not only help in controlling floods but also help maintain the flow of water in the streams so that we get a steady supply of water. On the other hand, if trees are not present, rain hits the ground directly and may flood the area around it. Heavy rain may also damages the soil. Roots of trees normally bind the soil together, but in their absence the soil is washed away or eroded.<br/></p>
</div>
</div>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">The children spent an hour at Tibu’s village on their way back. The weather of the village was quite pleasant. Villagers told them that due to the surrounding forest, they receive good rainfall. The air also remained cool. Noise pollution, too is less because the forest absorbs the noise of the nearby highway. </p>
			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB">The children learnt about the history of the village. It surprised them that the villages and the agricultural fields of that area were created after clearing the forest about sixty years ago. Tibu’s grandfather told them that when he was young, the village was not as large as it was now. It was also surrounded <br/>by forests. Construction of roads, buildings, industrial development and increasing demand of wood created pressure on the forests and it started vanishing. He was not happy that the forest adjoining their village is not regenerating and is on the verge of disappearing due to overgrazing of animals and indiscriminate felling of trees. Prof Ahmad said that if we did things wisely we could preserve forests and environment as well as have development. </p>

			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">At the end of the visit, Prof Ahmad asked children to sum up the importance of forests. The children wrote: Forests provide us with oxygen. They protect soil and provide habitat to a large number of animals. Forests <br/>help in bringing good rainfall in neighbouring areas. They are a source of medicinal plants, timber and many other useful products. We must preserve our forests.</span><span xml:lang="en-US"> </span></p>

In India the area under forest cover is about 21% of the total area. It had steadily been falling since independence. But people now seem to have realised the importance of the forest cover. Reports suggest that the area under forest cover has slightly increased in recent years.<br/></div>
