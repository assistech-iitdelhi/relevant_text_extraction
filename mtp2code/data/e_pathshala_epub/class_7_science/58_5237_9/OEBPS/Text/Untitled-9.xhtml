			<p class="Running-text" xml:lang="en-GB"><span xml:lang="en-US">The size of the particles in a soil has an influence on its properties. Sand particles are quite large. They cannot fit close together, so there are large spaces between them. These spaces are filled with air. We say that the sand is well aerated. Water can drain quickly through the spaces between the sand particles. So, sandy soils tend to be light, well aerated and rather dry. Clay particles, being much smaller, pack tightly together, leaving little space for air. Unlike sandy soil, water can be held in the tiny gaps between the par</span><span xml:lang="en-US">ticles of clay. So clayey soils have less air. But they are heavy as they hold more water than the sandy soils. </span></p>

Plant roots firmly bind the soil. In the absence of plants, soil becomes loose. So it can be moved by wind and flowing water. Erosion of soil is more severe in areas of little or no surface vegetation, such as desert or bare lands. So, cutting of trees and deforestation should be prevented and effort should be made to increase the green areas.<br/></div>
