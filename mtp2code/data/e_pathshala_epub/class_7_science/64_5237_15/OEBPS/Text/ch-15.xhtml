			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">	1. Play with a mirror Write your name with a sketch pen on a thin sheet of paper, polythene or glass. Read your name on the sheet while standing in front of a plane mirror. Now look at your image in the mirror.</p>
			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">	2. 	A burning candle in water Take a shoe box, open on one side. Place a small lighted candle in it. Place a clear glass sheet (roughly 25 cm × 25 cm) infront of this candle (Fig. 15.33). Try to locate the image of the candle behind the glass sheet. Place a glass of water at its position. Ask your friends to look at the image of the candle through the sheet of glass. Ensure that candle is not visible to your friends. Your friends will be surprised to see the candle burning in water. Try to explain the reason.</p>

			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">		Try to make your own rainbow. You can try this project in the morning or in the evening. Stand with your back towards the Sun. Take a hosepipe or a water pipe used in the garden. Make a fine spray in front of you. You can see different colours of rainbow in the spray. </p>
			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">	4. 	Visit a laughing gallery in some science centre or a science park or a village <span class="char-style-override-7">mela</span>. You will find some large mirrors there. You can see your distorted and funny images in these mirrors. Try to find out the kind of mirrors used there. </p>
			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">	5. 	Visit a nearby hospital. You can also visit the clinic of an ENT <br/>specialist, or a dentist. Request the doctor to show you the mirrors used for examining ear, nose, throat and teeth. Can you recognise the kind of mirror used in these instruments? </p>
			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">	6. 	Role play</p>
			<p class="Exercise-1st-tab para-style-override-7">		Here is a game that a group of children can play. One child will be chosen to act as object and another will act as the image of the object. The object and the image will sit opposite to each other. The object will make movements, such as raising a hand, touching an ear etc. The image will have to make the correct movement following the movement of the object. The rest of the group will watch the movements of the image. If the image fails to make the correct movement, she/he will be retired. Another child will take her/his place and the game will <br/>continue. A scoring scheme can be introduced. The group that scores the maximum will be declared the winner. </p>
