During the day, the land gets heated faster than the water. The air over the land becomes hotter and rises up. The cooler air from the sea rushes in towards the land to take its place. The warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle (Fig. 4.11). The air from the sea is called the </span><span class="char-style-override-2" xml:lang="en-US">sea breeze</span><span xml:lang="en-US">. To receive the cooler sea breeze, the windows of the houses in coastal areas are made to face the sea.  At night it is exactly the reverse. The water cools down more slowly than the land.

The transfer of heat by radiation does not require any medium. It can take place whether a medium is present or not. When we sit in front of a room heater, we get heat by this process. A hot utensil kept away from the flame cools down as it transfers heat to the surroundings by radiation.
