<p class="Running-text">Before we discuss why water is getting scarce we must know how much water is available for use on our planet.</p>
			<h4 class="Main-Head">16.1 How much Water is Available</h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">Look at the picture of the earth taken from space. Why does it appear blue? Surely, you can guess! </p>
			<p class="Running-text">You are aware that about 71% of the earth’s surface is covered with water. Almost all the water on the earth is contained in the seas and oceans, rivers, lakes, ice caps, as groundwater and in the atmosphere. However, most of this water is not fit for human consumption directly. The water <span>that is fit for use is freshwater. Perform the following activity to estimate roughly <br/>the relative amount of water available in some of these sources. </span></p>

<h4 class="Main-Head">16.2 Forms of Water </h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">Are you afraid that continuous use will some day exhaust all the water available for use? You know that water on the earth has been maintained for millions of years by various processes which make the <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>water cycle</b></span>. You have studied the water cycle in Class VI. Write in your own words what you know about the water cycle. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">You know that when water circulates through the water cycle it can be found in all the three forms, i.e., solid, liquid and ga<span>s—</span>at any given time somewhere on the earth. The <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>solid</b></span> form, snow and ice, is present as ice caps at the poles of the earth, snow-covered mountains and glaciers. <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>Liquid</b></span> water is present in oceans, lakes, rivers, and even underground. The <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>gaseous</b></span> form is the water vapour present in the air around us. The continuous cycling of water among its three forms keeps the total amount of water on the earth constant even when the whole world is using it. Does it give you any relief? </p>

			<h4 class="Main-Head">16.3 Groundwater as an Important Source of Water</h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">If we dig a hole in the ground near a water body we may find that the soil is moist. The moisture in the soil indicates the presence of water underground. If we dig deeper and deeper, we would reach a level where all the space between particles of soil and gaps between rocks are filled with water (Fig. 16.7). The upper level of this layer is called the <span class="char-style-override-3">water table</span>. The water table varies from place to place, and it may even change at a given place. The water table may be at a depth of less than a metre or may be several metres below the ground. The water found below the water table is called groundwater. What is the source of this groundwater? </p>
<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-5" style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;"><img class="frame-26" src="../Images/16_06_fmt.png" alt="16_06.tif"/></div>

</div>
			<p class="Running-text">The rainwater and water from other sources such as rivers and ponds seeps through the soil and fills the empty spaces and cracks deep below the ground. The process of seeping of water into the ground is called <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>infiltration</b></span>. The groundwater thus gets recharged by this process. At places the groundwater is stored between layers of hard rock below the water table. This is known as an <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>aquifer</b></span>. Water in the aquifers can be usually pumped out with the help of tube wells or handpumps. </p>

<p class="Running-text">Can we keep on drawing water from under the ground? How will it affect the water table?<br/></p>
			<h4 class="Main-Head">16.4 Depletion of Water Table</h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">Water drawn from under the ground gets restored by seepage of rainwater. The water table does not get affected as long as we draw as much water as is replenished by natural processes. However, water table may go down if the water is not sufficiently replenished. This may happen due to many reasons. Increase in population, industrial and agricultural activities are some common factors affecting water table. Scanty rainfall is another factor that may deplete the water table. Yet another factor affecting water table could be deforestation and decrease in the effective area for seepage of water. </p>
			<h3 class="sub-head">Increasing population</h3>
			<p class="x1st-para">Increasing population creates demand for construction of houses, shops, offices, roads and pavements. This decreases the open areas like parks, and <span>playgrounds. This, in turn, decreases the seepage of rainwater into the ground. What could be the consequence? Recall that a </span><span class="char-style-override-5">pukka</span> floor does not allow water to seep in easily, while in a grass lawn water seeps through in no time. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Moreover a huge amount of water is required for construction work. Often groundwater is used for this purpose. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">So, on the one hand we are consuming more groundwater, and on the other we are allowing lesser water to seep into the ground. This results in depletion of water table. In fact, the water table in some parts of many cities has gone down to alarmingly low levels. </p>
			<h3 class="sub-head">Increasing industries</h3>
			<p class="x1st-para">Water is used by all the industries. Almost everything that we use needs water somewhere in its production process. The number of industries is increasing continuously. Water used by most of the industries is drawn from the ground. </p>
			<p class="Activity-Rule"><b><u>Activity 16.4</u></b></p>
			<p class="activity-text">Name some industries familiar to you. Make a list of the products obtained from these and used in our daily life. Discuss with your teacher and parents how the growing industrial activity is responsible for the depletion of water table.</p>
			<h3 class="sub-head">Agricultural activities</h3>
			<p class="x1st-para">A majority of farmers in India depend upon rains for irrigating their crops. Irrigation systems such as canals are there only in a few places. Even these systems may suffer from lack of water due to erratic rainfall. Therefore, farmers have to use groundwater for irrigation. Population pressure on agriculture forces increasing use of groundwater day by day. This results in depletion of water table. </p>
			<h4 class="Main-Head">­16.5 Distribution of <span class="char-style-override-10">w</span>ater<span class="char-style-override-3"></span></h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">The distribution of water over the globe is quite uneven due to a number of factors. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Some places have good amount of rain and are water-rich. On the other hand, there are deserts which have scanty rainfall. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">	India is a vast country and the rainfall is not the same everywhere. Some regions have excessive rains while some others have very little rainfall. Excessive rains cause floods, whereas the absence of rains results in droughts. Therefore, some regions in our country may have floods while others may suffer from droughts at the same time. </p>
			<p class="Activity-Rule"><b><u>Activity 16.5</u></b></p>
			<p class="activity-text"><span>Given here is the rainfall map of India (Fig. 16.8). It gives the average annual rainfall in different regions of our country.</span><span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>

			<p class="x1st-para">You have read in Class VI that in many places a regular supply of water is&#160;provided by a well-planned pipe system. When the civic authorities supply water through pipes not all of it may reach the destination. You might have seen water supply pipes leaking and a lot of water gushing out of the pipes. It is&#160;the responsibility of the civic authorities to prevent such wastage of precious water.</p>
			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-5" style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot from 2021-04-06 12-29-12" src="../Images/Screenshot%20from%202021-04-06%2012-29-12.png"/><br/></div>
			<p class="x1st-para"><br/></p>
			<p class="Running-text">Mismanagement or wastage may take place at the level of individuals also. All of us, knowingly or unknowingly, waste water while brushing teeth, shaving, bathing, washing and during many other activities. Leaking taps is another source of huge water wastage. We waste water as though we do not need water the next time! </p>
			<p class="Running-text">We have seen that most of the water that we get as rainfall just flows away. This is a waste of precious natural resource. The rainwater can be used to recharge the groundwater. This is referred to as <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>water harvesting</b></span> or <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>rainwater harvesting</b></span>, about which you have learnt in Class VI. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">Find out if the buildings in your neighbourhood have water harvesting systems installed. </p>
			<p class="Running-text"><span>We have at many places in India an age old practice of water storage and water recharge like the </span><span class="char-style-override-4"><b><i>bawris</i></b></span>. <i><span class="char-style-override-5">Bawri</span> </i><span class="char-style-override-5"><i>was the traditional way of collecting water</i>. </span>With time the <span class="char-style-override-5">bawris</span> fell into disuse and garbage started piling in these reservoirs. However, because of the acute water shortage, people in these areas have had to rethink. The <span class="char-style-override-5">bawris</span> are being revived. Today the situation is that inspite of scanty rains these places are managing their water needs well.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">A farmer using water in the field can also use water economically. Maybe you have heard of <span class="char-style-override-3"><b>drip irrigation</b></span><span class="char-style-override-4"> </span>(Fig. 16.9)<span class="char-style-override-5">. </span>Drip irrigation is a technique of watering plants by making use of narrow tubings which deliver water directly at the base of the plant. </p>

<div>Bhujpur in the Kutch area of Gujarat has a very erratic rainfall. The only source of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water throughout the year. Over the years, demand for water has grown. The withdrawal of groundwater has far exceeded recharge. As a result the water table has gone down alarmingly.</div>
<div>In 1989, the villagers along with a non-governmental organisation, decided to harvest rainwater. Eighteen check-dams were built on the Rukmavati river and its many tributaries. The water so collected increased percolation through the soil and recharged the aquifers.</div>
<div>According to farmers, the wells have water now and the water that flowed into the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation.</div>
