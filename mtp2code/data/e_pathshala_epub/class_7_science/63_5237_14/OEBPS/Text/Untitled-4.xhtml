			</div>
			<p class="x1st-para"><span class="char-style-override-1">Y</span>ou might have tried the game ‘How steady is your hand?’ suggested in Chapter 12 of Class VI. If not, you may try it out now. Paheli and Boojho had also set up the game by connecting an electric circuit as suggested in Class VI. They had lots of fun trying it out with their families and friends. They enjoyed it so much that they decided to suggest it to a cousin of theirs who stayed in a <br/>different town. So, Paheli made a neat drawing showing how the various electric components were to be connected (Fig.14.1). </p>
			<p class="Running-text" style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Screenshot from 2021-04-05 12-10-26" src="../Images/Screenshot%20from%202021-04-05%2012-10-26.png"/><br/></p>
<p class="Running-text">Can you draw this circuit conveniently? It made Boojho wonder if there was an easier way to represent these electric components.</p>
			<h4 class="Main-Head para-style-override-1">14.1 Symbols of Electric Components</h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">Some common electric components can be represented by symbols. In Table 14.1, some electric components and their symbols are shown. You may come across different symbols for these components in different books. However, in this book, we shall be using the symbols shown here.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Look at the symbols carefully. In the symbol for the electric cell, notice that there is a longer line and a shorter but thicker parallel line. Do you recall that an electric cell has a positive terminal and a negative terminal? In the symbol of the electric cell, the longer line represents the positive terminal and the thicker, shorter line represents the negative terminal. </p>
			<div class="Basic-Graphics-Frame frame-5">For a switch the ‘<span class="char-style-override-3">ON</span>’ position and the ‘<span class="char-style-override-3">OFF</span>’ position are represented by the symbols as shown. The wires used to connect the various components in a circuit are represented by lines.<br/></div>
			<p class="Running-text">In Table 14.1, a battery and its symbol are also shown. Do you know what a <span class="char-style-override-4">battery</span> is? Look at the symbol of a battery. Can you make out what a battery could be? For some of the activities we may need more than one cell. So, we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig.14.2. Notice that the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. Such a combination of two or more cells is called a <span class="char-style-override-5">battery</span>.</p>
<p class="Running-text" style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Screenshot from 2021-04-05 12-11-59" src="../Images/Screenshot%20from%202021-04-05%2012-11-59.png"/><br/></p>
			<p class="Running-text">Many devices such as torches, transistors, toys, TV remote controls, use batteries. However, in some of these devices the electric cells are not always placed one after the other as shown in Fig. 14.2. Sometimes the cells are placed side by side. Then how are the terminals of the cells connected? Look carefully inside the battery compartment of any device. There is usually a thick wire or a metal strip connecting the positive terminal of one cell to the negative terminal of the next cell (Fig.14.3). In order to help you to place the cells correctly in the battery compartment, ‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols are usually printed there.</p>

We have also seen that compass needle gets deflected when the current flows in a nearby wire. Can you connect the two observations? When the current flows through a wire, does the wire behave like a magnet?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">This is what a scientist called <span class="char-style-override-5"><b>Hans Christian Oersted</b> </span>(Fig. 14.18)<span class="char-style-override-5"> </span>also wondered.<span class="char-style-override-5"> </span>He was the first person who noticed the deflection of compass needle every time the current was passed through the wire. </p>
			<p class="Running-text">So, when electric current passes through a wire, it behaves like a magnet. This is the magnetic effect of the electric current. In fact, an electric current can be used to make magnets. Do you find it too surprising?  Let us try it out.</p>

			<p class="Activity-Rule"><b><u>Activity 14.6</u></b></p>
			<p class="activity-text">Take around 75 cm long piece of insulated (plastic or cloth covered or enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail, say about <span>6</span>–10 cm long. Wind the wire tightly around the nail in the form of a coil. Connect the free ends of the wire to the terminals of a cell through a switch as shown in Fig 14.19. <span class="char-style-override-5"></span></p>
			<p class="Running-text">Place some pins on or near the end of the nail. Now switch on the current. What happens? Do the pins cling to the tip of the nail? Switch off the current. Are the pins still clinging to the end of the nail?</p>
			<p class="Running-text">The coil in the above activity behaves like a magnet when electric current flows through it. When the electric current is switched off, the coil generally loses its magnetism. Such coils are called <span class="char-style-override-5"><b>electromagnets</b></span>. The electromagnets can be made very strong and can lift very heavy loads. Do you remember the <span>crane about which you read in Chapter 13 </span>of Class VI? The end of such a crane has a strong electromagnet attached to it. The electromagnets are also used to separate magnetic material from the junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets to take out small pieces of magnetic material that have accidentally fallen in the eye. Many toys also have electromagnets inside them. </p>
			<h4 class="Main-Head">14.5 Electric Bell</h4>
			<p class="x1st-para">We are quite familiar with an electric bell. It has an electromagnet in it.  Let us see how it works.</p>
			<p class="Running-text">Fig. 14.20 shows the circuit of an electric bell. It consists of a coil of wire wound on an iron piece.  The coil acts as an electromagnet. An iron strip with a hammer at one end is kept close to the electromagnet. There is a contact screw near the iron strip. When the iron strip is in contact with the screw, the current flows through the coil which becomes an electromagnet. It, then, pulls the iron strip. In the process, the hammer at the end of the strip strikes the gong of the bell to produce a sound. However, when the electromagnet pulls the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.  The current through the coil stops flowing. Will the coil remain an electromagnet?</p>

			<p class="Running-text"><span>The coil is no longer an electromagnet.</span> It no longer attracts the iron strip. The iron strip comes back to its original position and touches the contact screw again. This completes the circuit. The current flows in the coil and the hammer strikes the gong again.   This process is repeated in quick succession. The hammer strikes the gong every time the circuit is completed.  This is how the bell rings.</p>
